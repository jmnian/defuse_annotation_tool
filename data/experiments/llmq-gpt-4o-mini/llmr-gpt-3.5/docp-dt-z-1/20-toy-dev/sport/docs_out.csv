Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins is preparing to make his season debut during the team's Week 3 matchup with the Washington Commanders.

Higgins told reporters on Friday that he ""feels great"" heading into the game, via NFL Network's Cameron Wolfe.

""Finally ready to get my feet wet this season and ready to go,"" he said.

Higgins has missed Cincinnati's first two games of the year after he suffered a hamstring injury in practice on Sept. 5.

It's worth noting that Bengals head coach Zac Taylor hasn't officially confirmed that Higgins will be active against Washington, but it's still a promising sign that the 25-year-old is confident in his ability to return.

He was listed as a limited participant in practice on Thursday and Friday in the Bengals' latest injury report.

Higgins was considered doubtful ahead of Cincinnati's Week 2 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs and he ultimately didn't suit up. He'll have an extra day to prepare for the Commanders, as they're set to clash with the Bengals on Monday Night Football.

The reintroduction of Higgins into Cincinnati's offense should provide a boost to a team that has started the 2024 season with a disappointing 0-2 record. The Bengals have averaged just 272 yards per game through two weeks, ranking No. 24 among all NFL teams.

Although Higgins was limited to just 12 appearances in 2023 due to hamstring issues, he was able to surpass 1,000 receiving yards in each of the prior two seasons.

His potential debut should also make life easier for three-time Pro Bowl wideout Ja'Marr Chase. Chase has been given extra attention from defenses to start the year, which has hampered his overall production. The 24-year-old has recorded just 10 catches for 97 yards in two games.",gpt-4o-mini,dt-z-1,"1.

Still, Nashville is a popular tourist destination, and Saban said he felt there were more Alabama supporters than Vanderbilt fans in attendance when the Crimson Tide would visit.

Fantasy football managers should avoid starting veteran running back Kareem Hunt even though he was signed to the Kansas City Chiefs' practice squad on Tuesday.

According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid confirmed that Hunt will not be elevated to Kansas City's active roster for a matchup with the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday.

With starting running back Isiah Pacheco currently on injured reserve due to a leg injury, Samaje Perine should see the majority of available snaps in the backfield.

Reid is likely giving Hunt more time to learn the Chiefs' playbook and prepare for his 2024 debut, as he's spent the past five seasons on the Cleveland Browns after his 2018 campaign in Kansas City.

He'll still have time to move up from the practice squad, as Pacheco is expected to miss at least six weeks after suffering a fractured fibula during the team's win over the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 2.

In the meantime, Perine will start for Kansas City on Sunday. The veteran has primarily operated in a complementary role for the Denver Broncos and Cincinnati Bengals over the past two seasons, offering value on the ground and through the air.

He's only started three games over that span, but the results are promising. In those three starts, Perine recorded 186 yards on the ground and 157 yards as a receiver.

Kenny Omega has not wrestled since December or appeared on AEW programming in any capacity since May, and comments made by the former AEW world champion on Friday suggest his absence may not be coming to an end any time soon. In a post on X in which he hyped the inclusion of fellow AEW star Samoa Joe in the upcoming Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii video game, Omega noted that he is ""not medically cleared"" to compete:

The manner in which Omega revealed the information suggests he could be joking, but he has indeed battled his fair share of health issues since the inception of AEW. His most recent ailment is a bout with diverticulitis. When Omega appeared on an episode of Dynamite in May, he said he required surgery and noted that doctors told him he was lucky to be alive. Omega was then written off TV again due to an attack by Elite members The Young Bucks, Jack Perry and Kazuchika Okada. When Okada signed with AEW, it was an exciting prospect for wrestling fans since it meant the potential reprisal of his classic rivalry with Omega during their time together in New Japan Pro-Wrestling. That is likely still the end goal once Omega returns, but there remains no publicly known timeline for that to happen.

Josh Allen has some advice for Caleb Williams

During an appearance on The Facility on FS1, the Buffalo Bills quarterback said that Williams needs to ""just keep playing football"" and that a rough start can be overcome.

""If the first couple of games in your NFL career don't go your way, it doesn't mean it will define your career,"" Allen said. ""I think he's got to just keep working hard and playing football the way he knows how to play the game.""

Williams was the No. 1 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft after an elite college career at Oklahoma and USC. He won the 2023 Heisman Trophy and threw for 10,082 yards and 93 touchdowns in his career.

His NFL tenure has been much less successful so far, although it has barely started. He won his first start for the Chicago Bears but his performance was not a big reason why as he only threw for 93 yards and had a completion percentage under 50 percent.

In his second game against the Houston Texans, he went 23-37 for 174 yards but threw two interceptions in a 19-13 loss.

He has plenty of time to improve but the warning bells appear to be sounding. However, Allen may be the best example of how a player can overcome a slow start.

""The growth of their team,"" an AFC staffer told Walder. ""It's Dallas, they have more resources than anybody. It's been cool to see that department grow.""

Dallas' play during the 2023 regular season would have some wondering why a change in approach was necessary. The Cowboys went 12-5 and won the NFC East. This was the third consecutive season that the team qualified for the playoffs, but the Wild Card performance showed exactly what was wrong.

Amid his strong start to the 2024 season, Georgia quarterback Carson Beck has firmly entrenched himself in the conversation for the top signal-caller in the 2025 draft class.

As part of an analytics survey conducted by ESPN's Seth Walder, an NFL executive said they have Beck ranked as the top quarterback ahead of Colorado's Shedeur Sanders and the rest of next year's draft prospects.

It's no small thing for the Pacers to give up their No. 8 pick in 2023, but Walker needs a lot of time on the court to develop. He could become an impact power forward, but he won't get much chance behind Pascal Siakam and Obi Toppin.

Carter has a team-friendly contract at $12 million this season and $10.9 million next. He's still just 25, but at 6'10"", 270 pounds, he would give the Pacers a bigger, stronger backup to Myles Turner (who is in the last year of his contract).

Indiana also loses center Isaiah Jackson, who is extension-eligible this summer. While he's active and athletic, Jackson (6'9"", 205 lbs) doesn't have nearly the same heft as Carter, who better fills the team's rotational need than Jackson and Walker.

The Pacers need to return to the minimum of 14 standard contracts, but the team is awfully close to the NBA's $170.8 million luxury tax threshold. The best way to stay under would probably be converting Enrique Freeman or Tristen Newton.

Both were drafted in the second round and signed two-way contracts, but they would only count against the tax at almost $1.2 million.

The Baltimore Ravens and running back Justice Hill reportedly agreed to a contract extension Friday. According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, Hill and the Ravens came to terms on a two-year, $6 million deal. Hill, 26, has spent his entire five-year career in Baltimore, and he is now under contract with the team through the 2026 campaign thanks to his new pact. Baltimore originally selected Hill in the fourth round of the 2019 NFL draft after he enjoyed a standout collegiate career at Oklahoma State that included two 1,000-yard rushing seasons and 30 total rushing touchdowns over three seasons. Despite that, Hill had a fairly limited role in the Ravens' offense over his first three seasons, averaging about 182 rushing yards, eight catches for 49 yards and less than one touchdown per year during that stretch. Hill was utilized far more often last season, though, perhaps due in large part to the fact that running back J.K. Dobbins was lost for the season after just one game, while veteran running back Melvin Gordon struggled. Gus Edwards was the Ravens' go-to running back as a rusher last season, but Hill was the primary third-down back, and his stats improved as a result. In fact, Hill set career highs across the board with 84 carries for 387 yards and three touchdowns, plus 28 receptions for 206 yards and a score. The Ravens' backfield underwent some significant changes during the offseason, as both Edwards and Dobbins signed with the Los Angeles Chargers in free agency, while Baltimore signed longtime Tennessee Titans running back and potential future Hall of Famer Derrick Henry.",gpt-4o-mini,dt-z-1,"1.

His pre-draft evaluation likely took a hit because his production in his junior year dipped to 984 rushing yards after he impressed with 1,268 yards and 1,242 yards during his freshman and sophomore seasons, respectively. However, the Badgers installed a new offense in his junior year, which undoubtedly played a factor in his output.

Allen wasted no time proving his prognosticators wrong, as he's been one of New York's most impactful players over the past two weeks. The 20-year-old, who is the youngest player in the NFL, scored his first touchdown on a pass from Aaron Rodgers and rushed for the go-ahead score in the fourth quarter of the Jets' Week 2 win against the Tennessee Titans.

Allen was voted as the AFC Rookie of the Week, and he followed that up by recording a team-high 55 yards in Thursday night's win against the New England Patriots. He's impressed with his ability to run through contact and punish defenders whenever he touches the ball.
