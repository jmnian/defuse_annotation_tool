sport_1.json,4,yes,"In what ways has the Bengals' offense benefited from Higgins' absence, particularly in the passing game and red-zone opportunities?",gpt-3.5,"The Bengals' offense has benefited from Tee Higgins' absence in the passing game and red-zone opportunities in a few ways:

1. **Increased Attention on Ja'Marr Chase**: With Higgins out, defenses have been able to give extra attention to three-time Pro Bowl wideout Ja'Marr Chase. This has led to Chase being given extra attention from defenses, which has hampered his overall production.

2. **Opportunity for Other Receivers**: Higgins' absence has provided an opportunity for other receivers to step up and contribute in the passing game. With Higgins returning, the Bengals will have more depth and options in their receiving corps, which can help diversify their passing attack.

3. **Red-Zone Efficiency**: While not explicitly mentioned in the document, having a talented receiver like Tee Higgins back in the lineup can improve the Bengals' red-zone efficiency.
