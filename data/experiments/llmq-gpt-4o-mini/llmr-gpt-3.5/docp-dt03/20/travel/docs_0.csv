On Monday afternoon, Sept. 16, 2024, a 60-year-old woman visiting Yellowstone National Park from Windsor, New Hampshire, reportedly suffered second and third-degree burns to her lower leg while walking in a thermal area near Mallard Lake Trailhead at Old Faithful.

The woman was walking off-trail with her husband and leashed dog in a thermal area when she broke through a thin crust over scalding water and suffered burns to her leg. The husband and dog were not injured.

The woman and her husband went to a park medical clinic where they were evaluated. The patient was later transported via helicopter to Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center for further treatment.

Visitors are reminded to stay on boardwalks and trails in hydrothermal areas and exercise extreme caution. The ground in these areas is fragile and thin, and there is scalding water just below the surface. Learn more about safety in thermal areas.

Pets are prohibited on boardwalks, hiking trails, in the backcountry and in thermal areas.

This incident is under investigation and the park has no additional information to share.

This is the first known thermal injury in Yellowstone in 2024.

Current Volcano Alert Level: NORMAL

Current Aviation Color Code: GREEN



This is an update on the hydrothermal explosion that occurred just before 10 AM on Tuesday, July 23, in Biscuit Basin, Yellowstone National Park. National Park Service (NPS) field crews have completed a preliminary assessment of the conditions following the hydrothermal explosion at Black Diamond Pool. For a map showing the locations of the features in that area, see https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/map-major-features-biscuit-basin-yellowstone-national-park. What happened? The July 23, 2024, hydrothermal explosion at Biscuit Basin resulted from water suddenly transitioning to steam in the shallow hydrothermal system beneath Black Diamond Pool and was not caused by volcanic activity. Seismicity, ground deformation, and gas and thermal emissions remain at their normal background levels, and there were no detectable precursors to this event. The explosion, which sent steam and debris to a height of hundreds of feet above the ground, destroyed a nearby boardwalk and ejected grapefruit-sized rocks tens to hundreds of feet from the source. Some blocks closest to the explosion site are about 3 feet (1 meter) wide and weigh hundreds of pounds. The explosion was largely directed to the northeast toward the Firehole River, and the largest blocks of debris fell in that direction.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

July 24, 2024

Contact: Morgan Warthin, (307) 344-2015

Bison will be managed within a population range of about 3,500 and 6,000 after calving and average about 5,000, consistent with the 10-year average. The NPS will work with IBMP partners to control bison population numbers using: Bison Conservation Transfer Program (BCTP) to restore bison to Tribal lands. Tribal Food Transfer Program* (TFTP) to provide meat and hides to Tribes. Tribal and state harvests outside the park. The NPS will prioritize the BCTP and place bison in the BCTP when bison migrate to the park boundary and there is space in the facility. The NPS will establish a population assurance threshold of 5,200 bison. This action was not in the original IBMP. When the population reaches this threshold, the NPS will begin to manage for a declining bison population by relying primarily on Tribal and state harvests. If harvests do not reduce numbers, the NPS will remove additional bison through the TFTP. When the population is below 5,200, the NPS will only place bison in the BCTP and use the TFTP to remove brucellosis-positive bison that are identified when animals are selected for the BCTP. If the late-winter population nears 3,000 animals, the NPS will protect the population inside the park and encourage partners to reduce hunting outside the park. MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS, WY – Today, July 24, the National Park Service (NPS) announced a decision about the future management of bison at Yellowstone National Park. The Record of Decision , a culmination of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and National Environmental Policy Act process that began in 2022, will allow the NPS to manage bison based on new scientific information and circumstances that have changed since the previous EIS, completed in 2000.The NPS is implementing this decision because of new scientific information about bison and brucellosis transmission and changed circumstances that include fewer cattle near the park, brucellosis regulations, and Tribal hunting.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

The Gibbon River and all associated tributaries downstream of Norris Campground.

The closure will be reassessed when water temperatures cool and flows return to more typical summer conditions.

Staff will continue to monitor park rivers and streams for warm temperatures and low flows, and watch weather forecasts. The extended forecast calls for continued hot and dry conditions with a slight chance of isolated afternoon thunderstorms, which contribute to continued low stream flows and warm-water temperatures.

Additional closures or restrictions may be implemented if necessary.

What will be open?

Yellowstone Lake and other lakes will remain open to fishing from sunrise to sunset as specified in the Fishing Regulations 2024 booklet.

All other rivers and streams not listed as closed.

MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS, WY – On the morning of July 4, Yellowstone National Park law enforcement rangers confronted an individual shooting a semi-automatic rifle toward a dining facility at Canyon Village located in the central part of the park. The shooter has been identified by the Park County, Wyoming coroner as Samson Lucas Bariah Fussner, 28, of Milton, Florida. Fussner died after an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement. The investigation into this incident, including the actions of the National Park Service (NPS) law enforcement rangers, is being led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and will be reviewed by the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Wyoming. Just after midnight on July 4, Yellowstone’s 911 dispatch center received a report that a woman had been held against her will by a man with a gun in a residence at Canyon Village. She also reported to law enforcement rangers that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including plans to allegedly carry out a mass shooting(s) at July 4th events outside the park. Responding law enforcement rangers located his vehicle unoccupied in the Canyon area. The preliminary investigation indicated Fussner was likely armed and dangerous. With the individual at large, law enforcement rangers were strategically deployed to protect areas with park visitors and employees while searching for Fussner, and the park’s 911 dispatch center notified surrounding jurisdictions.

MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS, WY – Today, June 6, the National Park Service (NPS) released the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for a Bison Management Plan at Yellowstone National Park. The FEIS presents a broad range of actions for managing bison inside the park. This plan allows the NPS to manage bison based on new scientific information and changed circumstances, explore ways to increase the transfer of bison to American Indian Tribes, and continue working closely with Tribal Nations and agency partners in management.The purpose of the EIS is to preserve an ecologically sustainable population of wild and migratory bison while continuing to work with partners to address issues related to brucellosis transmission, human safety, property damage, and to fulfill Tribal trust responsibilities.The FEIS solidifies the significant progress made over the past two decades by the Interagency Bison Management Plan (IBMP) partners and continues Yellowstone National Park’s commitment to the IBMP objectives which include: 1) maintain a wild, free-ranging bison population; 2) reduce the risk of brucellosis transmission from bison to cattle; 3) manage bison that leave Yellowstone National Park and enter the State of Montana; and 4) maintain Montana’s brucellosis-free status for domestic livestock.The FEIS also considers the bison management actions likely to occur on lands outside the park in Montana, maintains NPS’s continued commitment to working with the State of Montana, Tribes, and other federal partners to balance bison management efforts, while acknowledging the NPS does not have jurisdiction or control over actions such as hunting or tolerance for bison beyond the park boundary.The NPS’s FEIS considers alternatives to managing bison with varying population ranges and management activities.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03
