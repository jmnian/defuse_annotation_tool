Storm Boris is the latest deluge in one of the most flood-plagued periods in Europe in the past 500 years, but one city escaped relatively unscathed. The steps Vienna took to prepare for extreme rainfall may hold lessons for how other cities can face deluges to come. And yet, considering the onslaught of water, ""we got away quite lightly"", noted a Viennese journalist, referring to reports of an estimated ten lightly injured people, and 15 evacuated houses in the city. ""On the whole, the [city's] ingenious flood management system resisted the masses of water,"" concluded another local journalist. In fact, evidence from previous big floods suggests that a number of protective strategies used by Vienna, and Austria more generally, are proving effective – and offering vital lessons to others battling increasingly extreme weather. ""Austria has really invested in flood management over the past decades, not least because we had two big floods, in 2002 and 2013,"" says Günter Blöschl, a hydrologist and director of the Centre for Water Resource Systems of the Vienna University of Technology, who has helped shape Austria's flood risk management strategy. In Vienna, a flood defence system developed decades ago has played a crucial role in protecting the city, Blöschl explains.

Chocolate has long been considered a possible cause of acne, alongside other sweet treats. But it appears that bad reputation may be undeserved. Chocolate has long had a reputation for causing spots. Is there any truth to it? Or is it just something parents tell their kids to avoid shelling out on sweet treats at the supermarket? In the 1960s, several studies analysed the relationship between chocolate and acne. The biggest study – which only recruited 65 participants – found no relationship between the two. But this study has since been criticised for having numerous design flaws. While chocolate may be off the hook, more recent studies suggest that there could, in fact, be many connections between diet and acne – particularly the Western diet, which is high in saturated fat, sugar and dairy. Acne is a common skin condition where hair follicles in the skin become blocked by oil and dead skin cells, which causes spots to form. Severe or persistent acne from adolescence and adulthood is mostly caused by genetics, says Beibei Du-Harpur, dermatologist and clinical lecturer at Kings College London. This is because our genes determine the size of our skin's sebaceous glands, which produce oil.

In recent years, the relationship between chocolate consumption and acne has sparked considerable debate among dermatologists and nutritionists. While the age-old notion that chocolate causes pimples has often been dismissed, emerging research suggests that certain types of chocolate may indeed play a role in exacerbating this skin condition.

Particularly troubling are findings indicating that chocolates high in sugar and dairy could trigger breakouts, especially in adults. As the prevalence of adult acne rises—statistics show a significant increase in cases over the past few decades—many are left wondering if their favorite sweet treat is contributing to their skin woes.

Recent studies have highlighted a marked uptick in adult acne cases, a trend that is concerning for both health professionals and the public. As more adults grapple with this issue, understanding the dietary factors at play, including the potential impact of chocolate, becomes increasingly important.

As consumers navigate their diets in search of clearer skin, the discussion surrounding chocolate and its effects on acne will likely continue. For those struggling with this condition, it may be worth evaluating the types of chocolate consumed, opting for varieties lower in sugar and dairy, and consulting with a dermatologist for personalized advice."

For centuries meandering rivers have been straightened – but experts say restoring their natural bends and curves can prevent flooding and create healthy habitats for wildlife. Swindale Beck, a stream in Cumbria, in the heart of the UK's Lake District, meanders through fields, farmland and valleys. However, not long ago, the river took a far more linear course. A healthy river should be sinuous, free flowing and replete with wildlife. In Britain, however, 97% of rivers are fragmented by artificial barriers like weirs. Now, there is at least one artificial barrier for every 1.5km of stream in the country. And for centuries rivers have been slowly canalised – or artificially straightened – to stop water from flooding and spilling onto farmland and houses. But removing a river's natural meanders has, in fact, achieved the opposite effect. Instead, it's disrupted the flow of rivers and degraded aquatic habitats, water quality and heightened flood risk. As the poor health of Europe's rivers and streams continues to make news – due to dwindling wildlife, sewage pollution and agricultural runoff – communities are turning towards natural solutions to restore their rivers.

**Date: October 15, 2023**

Rivers play a crucial role in sustaining both the environment and local communities, providing essential resources such as water, food, and recreational opportunities. However, the intricate balance of these vital waterways has been significantly disrupted by human activities over the past century. The construction of numerous dams and levees along riverbanks has altered natural water flow, primarily for navigation and development purposes. While these structures may seem beneficial for economic growth, they have inadvertently led to a decline in water quality and the degradation of river ecosystems.

The barriers erected along rivers often block the natural migration of fish, which is critical for maintaining healthy aquatic populations. Additionally, the alteration of rivers has affected sediment flow, resulting in increased erosion and the loss of important habitats. Urban development has further compromised floodplains, diminishing their ability to absorb excess rainwater and support biodiversity.

In recognition of these challenges, communities and local governments are increasingly prioritizing river restoration efforts. Sustainable management practices are being implemented to enhance the health of these waterways. Techniques such as reintroducing natural meanders and restoring wetlands are gaining traction as effective methods to revive river ecosystems.

Community leaders emphasize the importance of healthy rivers for overall well-being. “Our rivers are not just waterways; they are lifelines that support our environment and our communities,” stated environmental advocate Jane Doe. “Investing in their restoration is essential for our future.”

As awareness grows, many local governments are channeling resources into sustainable initiatives that promote the resilience of river ecosystems. These efforts signify a collective commitment to restoring the natural beauty and functionality of rivers, ensuring they continue to provide for generations to come. 

In conclusion, the path to revitalizing our rivers is challenging but necessary. By prioritizing sustainable practices and recognizing the intrinsic value of healthy waterways, communities can foster a thriving ecosystem that benefits all."

Forty years ago, Bob Cialdini published a groundbreaking book on the power of influence. In our digital age, these rules may have become even more powerful. One day Robert Cialdini was in his university dorm, when he answered the door to another resident who was selling subscriptions to Sports Illustrated magazine. ""I was a starving student; I didn't have a lot of discretionary income,"" Cialdini recalls. ""So I wasn't going to buy his magazine."" The guy was persistent, however. He told Cialdini that he would be missing out on a unique sale that would only last for that weekend. He emphasised the fact that the top pundits rated the magazine very highly. And he casually mentioned that he'd already sold a lot of subscriptions to the other dormmates. Cialdini soon gave in. When the man had left, he leant back against the door and took stock of what had just happened. ""I thought, 'You spent your money, and it wasn't because of the merits of the thing – it was the way he presented it,'"" Cialdini recalls. ""And I thought, 'Isn't that interesting? Isn't that worth studying?'"" Cialdini's curiosity would lead him to write Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, published in 1984. Melding academic research on behavioural science with apposite case studies and personal experience, it arguably created the mould for ""smart thinking"" authors such as Charles Duhigg, Adam Grant or James Clear.

In tropical storms, location matters when it comes to what damage to expect – especially if you're on the ""dirty"" side of a hurricane, where winds can be up to 50% stronger. Hurricanes can be difficult to forecast. The speed and path of a hurricane depend on a complex interaction between the storm and its own internal circulations, and the Earth's atmosphere. High- and low-pressure systems can alter the speed and path of a hurricane, while the air which the hurricane is embedded in and travelling through is constantly moving and changing. They typically move at a speed of 15 to 20mph (24 to 32km/h), but some linger – causing devastatingly heavy rain and flooding. They can speed up – reaching 60mph (97km/h) and travel in a straight line, or they can wobble and loop. 2024 HURRICANE SEASON As Hurricane Francine slammed the southern US with strong winds and heavy rainfall, communities in Louisiana were hit by flooding, while in Alabama and Mississippi, thousands have been left without electricity.

As the Atlantic hurricane season approaches, coastal communities are urged to ready themselves for potential storms. Hurricanes, which form over warm ocean waters, require specific atmospheric conditions, including humidity and low wind shear, to develop. The process typically begins with a tropical disturbance, which can escalate into a tropical depression and, subsequently, a fully-fledged hurricane if conditions remain favorable.

To gauge the severity of these storms, meteorologists employ the Saffir-Simpson scale, a classification system that categorizes hurricanes based on their wind speed and the potential damage they could inflict. This scale ranges from Category 1, with winds of 74-95 mph, to Category 5, with winds exceeding 157 mph, indicating catastrophic damage.

In light of these threats, local authorities emphasize the importance of preparedness.

As they barrel over the oceans, they turn its heat into brutal kinetic energy that flattens islands and inundates coastal cities, taking months of urgent repair work to heal. Ocean temperatures are now breaking all records, and these ""engines"" are responding accordingly, cutting different paths across the ocean, slowing down, and becoming less predictable and more dangerous. Now there's a race to understand exactly how hurricanes are rewriting the rules and patterns we've seen before, in the hope of learning how we can adapt. A longer season

There's a distinct seasonal cycle to hurricanes in the Atlantic, with very few or none at all in winter, and a peak in September.

A groundbreaking study published in the prestigious journal *Environmental Science Letters* has shed light on the increasingly severe and unpredictable nature of storms as a direct consequence of climate change. The research, conducted by a team of climatologists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), emphasizes the urgent need for communities to adapt their strategies in the face of these changing weather patterns.

The study’s findings indicate that storms are not only intensifying but are also becoming erratic, making them harder to predict. This unpredictability poses significant risks to coastal cities which are particularly vulnerable to storm damage. As a result, many municipalities are now implementing innovative strategies aimed at mitigating the impact of storms and enhancing their resilience.

Coastal cities across the nation are adopting a range of measures, including the construction of improved drainage systems, the establishment of storm surge barriers, and the restoration of natural buffers such as wetlands. These initiatives are designed to protect infrastructure, safeguard residents, and ensure the sustainability of local economies.

In light of these findings, researchers are urging communities to take proactive steps in preparing for increased storm activity. “The evidence is clear: climate change is driving more severe weather events,” said Dr. Emily Carter, lead author of the study. “It is imperative that we invest in resilience strategies now to protect our communities for the future.”

As the threat of climate change looms larger, the message is clear: preparation and adaptation are no longer optional but necessary for the safety and sustainability of coastal regions."

Research shows 25% of web pages posted between 2013 and 2023 have vanished. A few organisations are racing to save the echoes of the web, but new risks threaten their very existence. It's possible, thanks to surviving fragments of papyrus, mosaics and wax tablets, to learn what Pompeiians ate for breakfast 2,000 years ago. Understand enough Medieval Latin, and you can learn how many livestock were reared at farms in Northumberland in 11th Century England – thanks to the Domesday Book, the oldest document held in the UK National Archives. Through letters and novels, the social lives of the Victorian era – and who they loved and hated – come into view. But historians of the future may struggle to understand fully how we lived our lives in the early 21st Century. That's because of a potentially history-deleting combination of how we live our lives digitally – and a paucity of official efforts to archive the world's information as it's produced these days. However, an informal group of organisations are pushing back against the forces of digital entropy – many of them operated by volunteers with little institutional support.

Human innards are teeming with viruses that infect bacteria. What are they up to? You've probably heard of the microbiome – the hordes of bacteria and other tiny life forms that live in our guts. Well, it turns out those bacteria have viruses that exist in and around them – with important consequences for both them and us. Meet the phageome. There are billions, perhaps even trillions of these viruses, known as bacteriophages (""bacteria eaters"" in Greek) or just ""phages"" to their friends, inside the human digestive system. Phageome science has skyrocketed recently, says Breck Duerkop, a bacteriologist at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine, and researchers are struggling to come to grips with their enormous diversity. Researchers suspect that if physicians could harness or target the right phages, they might be able to improve human health. ""There will turn out to be good phages as well as bad phages,"" says Paul Bollyky, an infectious disease physician and researcher at Stanford Medicine. But for now, it's still not clear how many phages occupy the gut – perhaps one for each bacterial cell, or even fewer. There are also bacteria that contain phage genes but aren't actively producing viruses – the bacteria are just living their lives with phage DNA tagging along in their genomes. And there are lots of phages still unidentified. Scientists call these the ""dark matter"" of the phageome.

Phages operate with remarkable precision, infecting and destroying specific bacterial strains while leaving human cells unharmed. This unique ability positions phages as a potential alternative to traditional antibiotics, which have become less effective due to the rise of resistant bacteria.

With an astonishing estimated 10^31 phages on Earth, these microscopic entities outnumber bacteria by a significant margin. This vast population offers hope for the development of phage therapy, which has already been implemented in several countries as a viable treatment option for bacterial infections.

As researchers continue to explore the potential of phages, the scientific community remains optimistic about their future applications in medicine, particularly in the fight against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

The hunt for the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic has new leads. Researchers have identified half a dozen animal species that could have passed SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, to people, by reanalysing genomes collected from an animal market in Wuhan, China1. The study establishes the presence of animals and the virus at the market, although it does not confirm whether the animals themselves were infected with the virus. Many of the earliest cases of COVID-19 were linked to the city’s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, and so it became a focus in the search for the pandemic’s origin. The study, published in Cell today, is the latest in a series of analyses of the market samples. The researchers argue that their reanalysis adds more weight to the market being the site of the first spillover events, in which animals with the virus infected people, sparking the pandemic. This expands on a preliminary analysis on a subset of the China CDC data, which the same team published in March 2023. However, the team’s conclusion differs from the first peer-reviewed analysis of the data, published in Nature2 in April last year, in which a separate team also identified several animals and the virus but concluded the role of the market in the pandemic’s origin was unclear.

The work considers the mathematical concept of ‘tiling’: how shapes tessellate on a surface. The problem of filling a plane with identical tiles has been so thoroughly explored since antiquity that it’s tempting to suppose that there is nothing left to be discovered about it. But the researchers deduced the principles of tilings with a new set of geometric building blocks that have rounded corners, which they term ‘soft cells’. ‘Geometry can be very simple, but totally deep’: meet top maths prizewinner Claire Voisin

“Simply, no one has done this before”, says Chaim Goodman-Strauss, a mathematician at the National Museum of Mathematics in New York City, who was not involved in the work. “It’s really amazing how many basic things there are to consider.”

It has been known for millennia that only certain types of polygonal tile, such as squares or hexagons, can be packed together to fill 2D space with no gaps. Tilings that fill space without a regularly repeating arrangement, such as Penrose tilings, have attracted interest since the discovery of non-periodic structures called quasicrystals in the 1980s.

Various projections have suggested that carbon emissions from China, the world's largest emitter, will probably peak soon — if they haven’t already — well ahead of Beijing’s pledge that they would peak before 2030. “What happens with China’s emissions in the next year and next decade is absolutely decisive for the success of the global climate effort,” says Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst who has tracked China’s emissions trends for more than a decade and is a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, a think-tank based in Washington DC. “Once China’s emissions peak, it’s likely that global emissions will also reach their peak,” says Dave Jones, an electricity analyst at Ember, a London-based think-tank. But some researchers say that current peak predictions have big uncertainties owing to various factors, such as the future path of China’s economy. And although reaching the peak will be a major climate milestone, China's emissions must continue to fall to net zero, which could be challenging, say some researchers. Early peak

China reports its greenhouse-gas emissions to the United Nations through a national communication on climate change every four years and a separate report every two years. But those statistics have a major lag, and China’s latest ones were for 2018. Assessments by Myllyvirta suggest that China’s emissions have been declining since March. This points to a possible 2023 peak, he says, but only if China’s clean-energy production can stick to last year’s record-breaking growth rate in 2024 and its energy consumption drops to its pre-pandemic level.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

*Beijing, China* – As the world grapples with the urgent need to combat climate change, China finds itself at the center of global scrutiny as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Recent reports indicate that the Asian powerhouse is facing mounting pressure from both domestic stakeholders and the international community to take significant steps toward reducing its carbon footprint.

China's industrial sector plays a pivotal role in its emissions profile, contributing to a substantial percentage of the overall greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. The country’s rapid industrialization over the past few decades has led to an increase in energy demand, primarily sourced from coal, which remains the dominant fuel for electricity generation. Despite ongoing efforts to transition to cleaner energy alternatives, coal consumption remains alarmingly high, posing challenges to China's environmental goals.

In response to this growing concern, Chinese authorities are under increasing pressure to implement more aggressive policies aimed at curbing emissions. Activists, scientists, and foreign governments are calling for greater transparency and accountability in the country’s environmental policies. As the nation prepares for the upcoming international climate conferences, the world watches closely to see if China will take decisive action to alter its trajectory.

Experts warn that without significant changes, the long-term impacts of climate change could be devastating not only for China but for the entire planet. The time for action is now, and how China responds to this challenge could shape the future of global climate efforts."

A buildup of ‘goo’ in an appetite-control centre of the brain might worsen obesity and diabetes. In mice, researchers found that the scaffolding supporting neurons that adjust sensations of hunger changed as the mice gained weight on an unhealthy diet. The result was a thick and sticky goo that prevents these neurons from processing insulin signals. When the scientists chemically slowed the goo’s formation, the mice lost weight and became more responsive to insulin. The findings may point to new drivers of metabolic conditions, but investigating whether this goo forms in humans might be difficult, says neuroscientist and co-author Garron Dodd.

The deadly condition noma is awash with contradictions. It destroys tissue and bones in the most visible part of the body — the face — yet finding cases is difficult, because people who have been affected by the illness are often hidden away owing to stigma. It is typically perceived as a disease that affects people in only certain parts of Africa, yet it was found a century ago in Europe and North America and still affects people — typically children — around the world. Although the condition can be successfully treated with antibiotics, if caught early, anyone who is not treated at this stage is very likely to die. Noma begins as an infection in the mouth, often seen as swollen gums that fill with pus. Treatment with readily available antibiotics can stop the disease in its tracks. In the absence of early intervention, however, the infection becomes gangrenous and much tougher to treat; large parts of the face, tongue and jaw are destroyed. “From there on, you can just do wound treatment and stabilize the patient, such as giving them infusions of nutrients,” says Anaïs Galli, a researcher at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel, who has collaborated on a large study of noma.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

Noma, a severe gangrenous disease characterized by rapid tissue destruction in the mouth and face, remains a critical yet often overlooked health issue, particularly in underprivileged communities. This devastating condition typically arises from untreated dental caries, trauma, or infections, leading to catastrophic consequences if not addressed promptly.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified noma as a neglected tropical disease, which primarily affects children under the age of six in regions with limited access to healthcare. The disease progresses swiftly, resulting in extensive tissue necrosis that can disfigure and disable its victims, ultimately leading to a high mortality rate among those who do not receive timely medical intervention.

Experts emphasize the importance of early detection and treatment, which generally includes a regimen of antibiotics to combat the infection and nutritional support to enhance the patient’s overall condition. Without such measures, the prognosis for individuals afflicted with noma is grim, underscoring the urgent need for increased awareness and resources to combat this silent epidemic.

As communities and health organizations work together to address the root causes of noma, including poor oral hygiene and inadequate access to dental care, it is crucial to shine a light on this disease and advocate for the vulnerable populations that it disproportionately affects."

All eyes are on Missouri. Researchers are anxiously awaiting data from the midwestern state about a mysterious bird flu infection in a person who had no known contact with potential animal carriers of the disease. The data could reveal whether the ongoing US bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle has reached a dreaded turning point: the emergence of a virus capable of spreading from human to human. Huge amounts of bird-flu virus found in raw milk of infected cows

Thus far, data from the mysterious infection are few and far between: small snippets of the H5N1 virus’s genome sequence and an incomplete infection timeline. Ratcheting up concerns is the fact that no Missouri dairy farms have reported a bird flu outbreak; this might be because there really are no infections, or because the state does not require farmers to test their cows for the virus. “The fear is that the virus is spreading within the community at low levels, and this is the first time that we’re detecting it,” says Scott Hensley, a viral immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. “There’s no data to suggest that to be the case, but that’s the fear.”
