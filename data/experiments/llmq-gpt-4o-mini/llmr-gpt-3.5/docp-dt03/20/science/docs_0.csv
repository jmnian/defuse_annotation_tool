Storm Boris is the latest deluge in one of the most flood-plagued periods in Europe in the past 500 years, but one city escaped relatively unscathed. The steps Vienna took to prepare for extreme rainfall may hold lessons for how other cities can face deluges to come. And yet, considering the onslaught of water, ""we got away quite lightly"", noted a Viennese journalist, referring to reports of an estimated ten lightly injured people, and 15 evacuated houses in the city. ""On the whole, the [city's] ingenious flood management system resisted the masses of water,"" concluded another local journalist. In fact, evidence from previous big floods suggests that a number of protective strategies used by Vienna, and Austria more generally, are proving effective – and offering vital lessons to others battling increasingly extreme weather. ""Austria has really invested in flood management over the past decades, not least because we had two big floods, in 2002 and 2013,"" says Günter Blöschl, a hydrologist and director of the Centre for Water Resource Systems of the Vienna University of Technology, who has helped shape Austria's flood risk management strategy. In Vienna, a flood defence system developed decades ago has played a crucial role in protecting the city, Blöschl explains. ""Vienna's flood defence system is designed to cope with a flood discharge of 14,000 cubic metres per second – that's equivalent to a 5,000-year flood,"" he says.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

Chocolate has long been considered a possible cause of acne, alongside other sweet treats. But it appears that bad reputation may be undeserved. Chocolate has long had a reputation for causing spots. Is there any truth to it? Or is it just something parents tell their kids to avoid shelling out on sweet treats at the supermarket? In the 1960s, several studies analysed the relationship between chocolate and acne. The biggest study – which only recruited 65 participants – found no relationship between the two. But this study has since been criticised for having numerous design flaws. While chocolate may be off the hook, more recent studies suggest that there could, in fact, be many connections between diet and acne – particularly the Western diet, which is high in saturated fat, sugar and dairy. Acne is a common skin condition where hair follicles in the skin become blocked by oil and dead skin cells, which causes spots to form. Severe or persistent acne from adolescence and adulthood is mostly caused by genetics, says Beibei Du-Harpur, dermatologist and clinical lecturer at Kings College London. This is because our genes determine the size of our skin's sebaceous glands, which produce oil.

Cases of adult acne have been on the rise in recent years, especially in women, but there's no one single reason for this, says Du-Harpur. But, she adds, certain environmental factors in our daily lives that could be playing a role.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

For centuries meandering rivers have been straightened – but experts say restoring their natural bends and curves can prevent flooding and create healthy habitats for wildlife. Swindale Beck, a stream in Cumbria, in the heart of the UK's Lake District, meanders through fields, farmland and valleys. However, not long ago, the river took a far more linear course. A healthy river should be sinuous, free flowing and replete with wildlife. In Britain, however, 97% of rivers are fragmented by artificial barriers like weirs. Now, there is at least one artificial barrier for every 1.5km of stream in the country. And for centuries rivers have been slowly canalised – or artificially straightened – to stop water from flooding and spilling onto farmland and houses. But removing a river's natural meanders has, in fact, achieved the opposite effect. Instead, it's disrupted the flow of rivers and degraded aquatic habitats, water quality and heightened flood risk. As the poor health of Europe's rivers and streams continues to make news – due to dwindling wildlife, sewage pollution and agricultural runoff – communities are turning towards natural solutions to restore their rivers.

Forty years ago, Bob Cialdini published a groundbreaking book on the power of influence. In our digital age, these rules may have become even more powerful. One day Robert Cialdini was in his university dorm, when he answered the door to another resident who was selling subscriptions to Sports Illustrated magazine. ""I was a starving student; I didn't have a lot of discretionary income,"" Cialdini recalls. ""So I wasn't going to buy his magazine."" The guy was persistent, however. He told Cialdini that he would be missing out on a unique sale that would only last for that weekend. He emphasised the fact that the top pundits rated the magazine very highly. And he casually mentioned that he'd already sold a lot of subscriptions to the other dormmates. Cialdini soon gave in. When the man had left, he leant back against the door and took stock of what had just happened. ""I thought, 'You spent your money, and it wasn't because of the merits of the thing – it was the way he presented it,'"" Cialdini recalls. ""And I thought, 'Isn't that interesting? Isn't that worth studying?'"" Cialdini's curiosity would lead him to write Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, published in 1984. Melding academic research on behavioural science with apposite case studies and personal experience, it arguably created the mould for ""smart thinking"" authors such as Charles Duhigg, Adam Grant or James Clear.

New York just passed a law on ""addictive"" social media feeds for children, but some researchers are questioning what that actually means. New York Governor Kathy Hochul was clear about her opinion of social media earlier this month, speaking at a press conference to announce the signing of two new state laws designed to protect under-18-year-olds from the dangers the online world. The apps are responsible for transforming ""happy-go-lucky kids into teenagers who are depressed"", she said, but according to Hochul, the legislation she signed off on would help. ""Today, we save our children,"" Hochul said. ""Young people across the nation are facing a mental health crisis fuelled by addictive social media feeds."" Starting in 2025, these new laws could force apps including TikTok and Instagram to send some children back to the earliest days of social media, before content was tailored by users' ""likes"" and tech giants collected data about our interests, moods, habits and more. The Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (SAFE) for Kids Act requires social media platforms and app stores seek parental consent before children under 18 use apps with ""addictive feeds"", a groundbreaking attempt to regulate algorithmic recommendations. The SAFE Act will even prevent apps from sending notifications to child or teenage users between midnight and 6am – practically a legal bedtime for devices – and require better age verification to avoid children slipping through undetected.

In tropical storms, location matters when it comes to what damage to expect – especially if you're on the ""dirty"" side of a hurricane, where winds can be up to 50% stronger. Hurricanes can be difficult to forecast. The speed and path of a hurricane depend on a complex interaction between the storm and its own internal circulations, and the Earth's atmosphere. High- and low-pressure systems can alter the speed and path of a hurricane, while the air which the hurricane is embedded in and travelling through is constantly moving and changing. They typically move at a speed of 15 to 20mph (24 to 32km/h), but some linger – causing devastatingly heavy rain and flooding. They can speed up – reaching 60mph (97km/h) and travel in a straight line, or they can wobble and loop. 2024 HURRICANE SEASON As Hurricane Francine slammed the southern US with strong winds and heavy rainfall, communities in Louisiana were hit by flooding, while in Alabama and Mississippi, thousands have been left without electricity.

The behaviour of the world's most powerful storms is evolving. To adapt to more destructive hurricanes, typhoons and tropical cyclones, we need to know how they're changing. Fuelled by heat from ocean waters, hurricanes, typhoons and tropical cyclones are sometimes known as nature's steam engines. As they barrel over the oceans, they turn its heat into brutal kinetic energy that flattens islands and inundates coastal cities, taking months of urgent repair work to heal. Ocean temperatures are now breaking all records, and these ""engines"" are responding accordingly, cutting different paths across the ocean, slowing down, and becoming less predictable and more dangerous. Now there's a race to understand exactly how hurricanes are rewriting the rules and patterns we've seen before, in the hope of learning how we can adapt. A longer season

There's a distinct seasonal cycle to hurricanes in the Atlantic, with very few or none at all in winter, and a peak in September.

Human innards are teeming with viruses that infect bacteria. What are they up to? You've probably heard of the microbiome – the hordes of bacteria and other tiny life forms that live in our guts. Well, it turns out those bacteria have viruses that exist in and around them – with important consequences for both them and us. Meet the phageome. There are billions, perhaps even trillions of these viruses, known as bacteriophages (""bacteria eaters"" in Greek) or just ""phages"" to their friends, inside the human digestive system. Phageome science has skyrocketed recently, says Breck Duerkop, a bacteriologist at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine, and researchers are struggling to come to grips with their enormous diversity. Researchers suspect that if physicians could harness or target the right phages, they might be able to improve human health. ""There will turn out to be good phages as well as bad phages,"" says Paul Bollyky, an infectious disease physician and researcher at Stanford Medicine. But for now, it's still not clear how many phages occupy the gut – perhaps one for each bacterial cell, or even fewer. There are also bacteria that contain phage genes but aren't actively producing viruses – the bacteria are just living their lives with phage DNA tagging along in their genomes. And there are lots of phages still unidentified. Scientists call these the ""dark matter"" of the phageome. A big part of current phage research is to identify these viruses and their host bacteria.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

The hunt for the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic has new leads. Researchers have identified half a dozen animal species that could have passed SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, to people, by reanalysing genomes collected from an animal market in Wuhan, China1. The study establishes the presence of animals and the virus at the market, although it does not confirm whether the animals themselves were infected with the virus. Many of the earliest cases of COVID-19 were linked to the city’s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, and so it became a focus in the search for the pandemic’s origin. The study, published in Cell today, is the latest in a series of analyses of the market samples. The researchers argue that their reanalysis adds more weight to the market being the site of the first spillover events, in which animals with the virus infected people, sparking the pandemic. This expands on a preliminary analysis on a subset of the China CDC data, which the same team published in March 2023. However, the team’s conclusion differs from the first peer-reviewed analysis of the data, published in Nature2 in April last year, in which a separate team also identified several animals and the virus but concluded the role of the market in the pandemic’s origin was unclear. The search for how the pandemic began has been hugely controversial.

China reports its greenhouse-gas emissions to the United Nations through a national communication on climate change every four years and a separate report every two years. But those statistics have a major lag, and China’s latest ones were for 2018. Assessments by Myllyvirta suggest that China’s emissions have been declining since March.

Although the condition can be successfully treated with antibiotics, if caught early, anyone who is not treated at this stage is very likely to die. Noma begins as an infection in the mouth, often seen as swollen gums that fill with pus. Treatment with readily available antibiotics can stop the disease in its tracks. In the absence of early intervention, however, the infection becomes gangrenous and much tougher to treat; large parts of the face, tongue and jaw are destroyed. “From there on, you can just do wound treatment and stabilize the patient, such as giving them infusions of nutrients,” says Anaïs Galli, a researcher at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel, who has collaborated on a large study of noma.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

All eyes are on Missouri. Researchers are anxiously awaiting data from the midwestern state about a mysterious bird flu infection in a person who had no known contact with potential animal carriers of the disease. The data could reveal whether the ongoing US bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle has reached a dreaded turning point: the emergence of a virus capable of spreading from human to human.

Thus far, data from the mysterious infection are few and far between: small snippets of the H5N1 virus’s genome sequence and an incomplete infection timeline. Ratcheting up concerns is the fact that no Missouri dairy farms have reported a bird flu outbreak; this might be because there really are no infections, or because the state does not require farmers to test their cows for the virus. “The fear is that the virus is spreading within the community at low levels, and this is the first time that we’re detecting it,” says Scott Hensley, a viral immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. “There’s no data to suggest that to be the case, but that’s the fear.”

A mystery case

On 6 September, Missouri public-health officials and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that an adult in the state had developed symptoms including chest pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, and was hospitalized owing to other medical conditions.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03
