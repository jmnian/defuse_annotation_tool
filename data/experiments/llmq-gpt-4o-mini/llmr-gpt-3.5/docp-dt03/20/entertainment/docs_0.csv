TMZ has the first video of federal agents making their surprise arrest in an NYC hotel lobby -- potentially his final moment of freedom for at least the next decade. The video clearly shows Diddy, clad in a black trench coat, walking into the Park Hyatt New York hotel in midtown Manhattan with his crew of several men -- but the moment he enters the lobby, law enforcement pounces, stops the mogul and separates him from his friends. You can see from Diddy's team's reaction ... they're unsure of what's happening, walking around the hotel lobby in shock as the rapper's taken away. More on that later. Sometime later, Diddy reappears on camera, but now his hands are cuffed behind his back as the feds escort him through the hallway and walk him into an elevator. Next, they march him through the lobby and out the front door of the hotel in clear view of NYC pedestrians on the sidewalk. As for Diddy's shocked friends in the lobby ... well, they weren't alone in that feeling. Diddy himself was also totally surprised. Remember, he'd come to NYC in anticipation of the indictment ... and we know he was planning to surrender on Tuesday -- but, instead, the feds showed up Monday night to make this arrest. Video taken just moments before the arrest shows how great of a time the rapper was having in NYC -- interacting with several excited fans he ran into on the streets.
