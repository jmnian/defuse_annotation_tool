In its classic guise, the Negroni, which is equal parts gin, Campari and sweet vermouth is the patron saint of the aperitivo: simultaneously bitter and sweet, powerful and refreshing. Negroni history

According to drinks writer Iain Meldrum, writing for The Scotsman, this classic cocktail's origins are somewhat murky – though, as origin stories go, the Negroni’s is as compelling, contentious and as varied as that of any comic book superhero. One of the few details not up for debate is that it was named after someone bearing the moniker Negroni. Whether he was an Italian Count recently back from his adventures in America (where he may or may not have variously been a rodeo rider, a banker or even a Count) or a Corsican General (who may also have been a Count) posted to Senegal in the middle of the 19 th century is quite fiercely contested, at least by those with a claim to the name. The fact that there is no mention of the drink prior to the 1950s only muddies the water further. Picture: Shutterstock

And, like any classic cocktail, the Negroni has several close cousins that vary in the addition, subtraction or substitution of just a single ingredient. Negroni Week

A celebration of the classic cocktail. Negroni week takes place in September. This year it's 16-22 September, and will see bars across the country serving up the drink.

Chef’s tables slightly fell out of favour as dining trends changed. Now some of Scotland’s best restaurants, including the Three Chimneys on Skye and The Table in Edinburgh are offering this dining experience once again.

It’s the brainchild of chef Craig Grozier, who is known for his innovative, wild Scottish cooking. With a career spanning nearly 26 years, Craig honed his craft working in high-end restaurants in Scotland and around the world before coming back home and creating Fallachan nearly 12 years ago. Inspired by the philosophy of Fallachan, the open kitchen, with a 12-cover communal chef's table, is a multi-functional dining space hosting a variety of culinary experiences on selected dates throughout the year.

The spirit of Corriecravie is matured initially in bourbon barrels before being finished in Oloroso sherry hogsheads sourced directly from producer Miguel Martin in Jerez, for around six months. The taste profile is slightly richer than the distillery’s flagship Kilmory expression, showing off a different side to the Lagg spirit, bringing to the fore notes of sweeter spices and rich fruits. The Corriecravie Edition is bottled in smaller quantities compared to the Kilmory edition. Concerto malted barley is used in the production here, with the malt peated to 50ppm, making this a softer smoky whisky.

Origin of autumn flavour and where to try it - including pumpkin spice latte, gin and chicken wings It's a flavour that has become synonymous with autumn, but where and when did pumpkin spice originate? From sweet coffees and biscuits to gin and chicken wings, there's many ways to enjoy pumpkin spice. Here we take a look at when the flavour first went mainstream, and the different ways you can try it this autumn. Origins of pumpkin spice

Pumpkin spice is a combination of seasonal spices, usually ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves, mixed with a pumpkin syrup or puree. These spices date back to the 18th century and, as mixed spice, were first seen in British cook books around 1795. The more recent trend for pumpkin spice comes from America and is tied to the Thanksgiving tradition of making pumpkin pie, which uses these spices and, of course, pumpkin. Starbucks popularised the flavour with the launch of their pumpkin spice latte in the USA and Canada over 20 years ago. Hard to believe as it's seen as quite a new flavour trend for some. Starbucks has made the pumpkin spice latte since 2003 Picture: Shutterstock

The coffee is made using a combination of Starbucks Espresso Roast, pumpkin spice flavoured sauce and steamed milk, topped with whipped cream and pumpkin pie spices – cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves. Pumpkin Spice lattes really took off in the UK a few years after the US launch and, since 2015, the Starbucks Pumpkin Spice blend has included real pumpkin. As well as the traditional pumpkin spice latte, Starbucks customers can also order a pumpkin spice cold brew coffee and iced pumpkin spice latte. Where to try pumpkin spice

Project 1927 is the first collaboration of its kind, uniting independent distilleries across Scotland to revive century-old production methods. Inspired by a historic early 20th-century guide to Scotch whisky production, this September marks the first time the public can experience these historic spirits, as each distillery’s unique new make spirit is released in a special collection, marking the beginning of their journey to becoming whisky. The Distillation of Whisky, 1927-1931, one of the few available practical first-hand resources dating from Scotch whisky’s early history, was republished by James Eadie Ltd in 2023 in collaboration with the British Library, and illuminates lost whisky-making techniques from the interwar years. Crafted at Ardnamurchan, Dornoch, Holyrood, InchDairnie, Lochlea, and ‘An Unnamed Farm Distillery in the Heart of the Kingdom of Fife’, with assistance from whisky expert Dave Broom and Alan Winchester, former master distiller of The Glenlivet, the inventive new make spirits were produced adhering to techniques derived from The Distillation of Whisky. Each distillery has drawn its own inspiration from the book to imitate production methods from 100 years ago, blending tradition with modern expertise to produce spirits that offer a truly unique taste of Scotch whisky’s rich heritage. This collaborative effort not only revives lost techniques but also sets a new benchmark in today's whisky industry. The distilleries had exclusive use of locally grown barley or those varieties that were grown in the 1920s as well as exclusive use of brewer's yeast for distilling, something which was standard at that time but is now almost unheard of.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

""If you have any plums in your garden, those work exceptionally well with brambles as a jam too. ""It’s worth bearing in mind that ripe brambles don’t contain much pectin, the soluble fibre needed for jams and jellies to set, so including some apple or plum in your mix will help – and you don’t need much of these: even just including 10 per cent apples or plums to 90 per cent brambles will do the trick.

It marks the first release by the distillery to use red wine casks from this region. The nine-year finish gives tasting notes of Indulgent and rich, caramelised cherry and apple intertwined with warming spice and toasted oak; an opulent, yet earthy liquid that's fruity and at the same time floral. This limited edition whisky is being released as a part of The Glenfiddich Grand Series, a collection that celebrates the unexpected collision between single malt and cultures from around the world. Brian Kinsman, Glenfiddich Malt Master said of the latest release: “Bordeaux red wine casks are incredibly versatile sources of flavour and recognised widely for their outstanding quality, providing the perfect opportunity for experimentation to develop a profound spirit. “Nine years spent cocooned in these extraordinary Bordeaux red wine casks results in an exceptionally vibrant liquid which intensifies Glenfiddich’s classic fruity character balanced somewhat unusually with notes of deep oak and warming vanilla. “Although wine is becoming an increasingly popular choice for maturation within the single malt category, it remains relatively rare to see whiskies finished in a Bordeaux red wine cask, making this an incredibly intriguing and collectable bottling.”

Claudia Falcone, Glenfiddich Global Brand Director added: “The addition of Grand Château to The Glenfiddich portfolio, experimenting with flavour combinations and an extended finishing period, establishes our position as a brand that continues to push the boundaries of whisky making. Grand Château allows us to explore the collision of different cultures, whilst taking luxury to new heights.”
