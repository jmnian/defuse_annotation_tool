In its classic guise, the Negroni, which is equal parts gin, Campari and sweet vermouth is the patron saint of the aperitivo: simultaneously bitter and sweet, powerful and refreshing. Negroni history

According to drinks writer Iain Meldrum, writing for The Scotsman, this classic cocktail's origins are somewhat murky – though, as origin stories go, the Negroni’s is as compelling, contentious and as varied as that of any comic book superhero. One of the few details not up for debate is that it was named after someone bearing the moniker Negroni. Whether he was an Italian Count recently back from his adventures in America (where he may or may not have variously been a rodeo rider, a banker or even a Count) or a Corsican General (who may also have been a Count) posted to Senegal in the middle of the 19 th century is quite fiercely contested, at least by those with a claim to the name. The fact that there is no mention of the drink prior to the 1950s only muddies the water further. Picture: Shutterstock

Origin of autumn flavour and where to try it - including pumpkin spice latte, gin and chicken wings It's a flavour that has become synonymous with autumn, but where and when did pumpkin spice originate? From sweet coffees and biscuits to gin and chicken wings, there's many ways to enjoy pumpkin spice. Here we take a look at when the flavour first went mainstream, and the different ways you can try it this autumn. Origins of pumpkin spice

Pumpkin spice is a combination of seasonal spices, usually ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves, mixed with a pumpkin syrup or puree. These spices date back to the 18th century and, as mixed spice, were first seen in British cook books around 1795. The more recent trend for pumpkin spice comes from America and is tied to the Thanksgiving tradition of making pumpkin pie, which uses these spices and, of course, pumpkin. Starbucks popularised the flavour with the launch of their pumpkin spice latte in the USA and Canada over 20 years ago. Hard to believe as it's seen as quite a new flavour trend for some. Starbucks has made the pumpkin spice latte since 2003 Picture: Shutterstock

The coffee is made using a combination of Starbucks Espresso Roast, pumpkin spice flavoured sauce and steamed milk, topped with whipped cream and pumpkin pie spices – cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves. Pumpkin Spice lattes really took off in the UK a few years after the US launch and, since 2015, the Starbucks Pumpkin Spice blend has included real pumpkin. As well as the traditional pumpkin spice latte, Starbucks customers can also order a pumpkin spice cold brew coffee and iced pumpkin spice latte. Where to try pumpkin spice

Crafted at Ardnamurchan, Dornoch, Holyrood, InchDairnie, Lochlea, and ‘An Unnamed Farm Distillery in the Heart of the Kingdom of Fife’, with assistance from whisky expert Dave Broom and Alan Winchester, former master distiller of The Glenlivet, the inventive new make spirits were produced adhering to techniques derived from The Distillation of Whisky.

""They are probably also the one wild food plant that many people still seek out and pick without even considering the activity to be foraging in the now- fashionable ‘foodie’ sense. ""I always make bramble jam in small batches as I find them – it’s quick, and it saves ‘faffing’ with big jelly pans, thermometers and all the other kit and caboodle you might associate with jam-making (and this, in my wee kitchen, is a definite blessing). ""Brambles also combine well with other autumn hedgerow harvest fruits: ripe black elderberries and crab apples with a little cinnamon for a rich, earthy jam, or a sweet-sour jelly combining brambles with a variable combination of rowan berries, rosehips or haws (all of which have inedible seeds). ""If you have any plums in your garden, those work exceptionally well with brambles as a jam too. ""It’s worth bearing in mind that ripe brambles don’t contain much pectin, the soluble fibre needed for jams and jellies to set, so including some apple or plum in your mix will help – and you don’t need much of these: even just including 10 per cent apples or plums to 90 per cent brambles will do the trick.

It marks the first release by the distillery to use red wine casks from this region.

This limited edition whisky is being released as a part of The Glenfiddich Grand Series, a collection that celebrates the unexpected collision between single malt and cultures from around the world. Brian Kinsman, Glenfiddich Malt Master said of the latest release: “Bordeaux red wine casks are incredibly versatile sources of flavour and recognised widely for their outstanding quality, providing the perfect opportunity for experimentation to develop a profound spirit. “Nine years spent cocooned in these extraordinary Bordeaux red wine casks results in an exceptionally vibrant liquid which intensifies Glenfiddich’s classic fruity character balanced somewhat unusually with notes of deep oak and warming vanilla. “Although wine is becoming an increasingly popular choice for maturation within the single malt category, it remains relatively rare to see whiskies finished in a Bordeaux red wine cask, making this an incredibly intriguing and collectable bottling.”

Claudia Falcone, Glenfiddich Global Brand Director added: “The addition of Grand Château to The Glenfiddich portfolio, experimenting with flavour combinations and an extended finishing period, establishes our position as a brand that continues to push the boundaries of whisky making.
