The confusing part in the question is that it assumes the central bank's stance on driving growth in the current economic climate has been explicitly mentioned in the provided document.

Lower interest rates can also lead to higher consumer spending and investment in the stock market, as individuals and businesses seek higher returns on their money than what they can get from traditional savings accounts.","Yes

This system allows banks to create money through the process of making loans.

economics_9.json,6,yes,What advantages does fractional reserve banking provide to the economy?,gpt-3.5,"Fractional reserve banking provides several advantages to the economy.

The loss of credibility could weaken public trust in the Fed's ability to manage the economy effectively through monetary policy tools like interest rate adjustments and open market operations.

Additionally, sustained financial losses could limit the Fed's ability to build up capital reserves, which are crucial for absorbing potential future losses or economic shocks. Without sufficient capital, the Fed may be more vulnerable to financial instability and may have less flexibility in responding to economic challenges.

2. **Money Supply**: Central banks can also adjust the money supply to control inflation. They may choose to reduce the money supply by selling government securities or raising reserve requirements for banks. This can help reduce the amount of money circulating in the economy, potentially curbing inflation.
