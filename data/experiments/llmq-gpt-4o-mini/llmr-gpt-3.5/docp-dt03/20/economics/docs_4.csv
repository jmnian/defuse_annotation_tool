He has raised the bidding for votes with a preposterous new interventionist proposal of his own—a plan to boost fertility rates by turning in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments into a free service, to be paid for by a combination of government subsidies and mandates on health insurers. Traditionally, advocacy of IVF subsidies has been a staple of the same groups on the “progressive” side of the culture wars that have championed government-subsidized abortions on demand, like the Center for Reproductive Rights. According to data from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, representing over 95 percent of IVF clinics in America, 390,000 IVF cycles were performed in 2022, which led to 91,771 births. The current cost of IVF and related procedures ranges from $15,000 to $30,000 per IVF cycle, making total current expenditures on the order of $8 billion per year. Murray Rothbard’s theoretical analysis of the economics of “free” services and the incidence of government-imposed extortion implies that the costs of providing IVF treatments for “free” could be far, far higher. There are estimates that only a quarter of those who desire IVF treatments can actually afford them at current prices, so artificially reducing the price paid by patients to zero might mean at least a four-fold increase in the number of IVF cycles administered. It might even mean more if clinics (which would also have no incentive to control costs) encourage a greater number of cycles per patient to increase the chances of achieving a successful pregnancy.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

In a bold statement that has sparked significant conversation ahead of the upcoming presidential election, a prominent political figure has stepped forward to address pressing fertility issues that affect millions of Americans. The advocate is calling for increased reproductive rights and improved healthcare access, particularly focusing on in vitro fertilization (IVF), which has emerged as a key issue in the electoral discourse.

As demand for IVF services continues to rise—approximately 1 million people in the U.S. seek treatment annually—the challenges surrounding the high costs associated with these procedures cannot be ignored. With the average cost of a single IVF cycle exceeding $12,000, many families find themselves grappling with financial burdens that can lead to both emotional and financial stress. 

The figure highlighted the growing public awareness surrounding infertility challenges, noting that more people are beginning to understand the impact of age and health factors on IVF success rates. This increased awareness is crucial, as many individuals and couples face difficulties not only in terms of the emotional toll of infertility but also the financial implications of pursuing treatment.

In response to these issues, several states have implemented laws mandating insurance coverage for IVF treatments. However, policymakers are currently exploring further reforms aimed at making these essential services more accessible to families in need. The political figure’s advocacy underscores the necessity for systemic change in reproductive healthcare, emphasizing that access to IVF should not be a luxury but a right for all those wishing to start a family.

As the election approaches, the dialogue surrounding reproductive rights, particularly in relation to IVF, is set to take center stage, with many hopeful for meaningful change that will alleviate the burdens faced by those navigating infertility.","1.

He was trying to provide commentary on the Fed’s half-point cut in the Federal Funds Rate, but he was juggling too many contradictory narratives. The contradictions start at the beginning. The Fed’s decision “was of minimal importance” but also a “momentous move.” It wasn’t important because it just a small change in the overnight interbank interest rate. It was very important because of its effect on other interest rates and because the Fed has “declared its belief that the war on inflation has been won.” Maybe Krugman was going for the antithesis literary device, like Neil Armstrong’s “small step for man, giant leap for mankind.” Maybe he wanted to downplay any immediate suspicions that such a large cut a few weeks before the presidential election would be politically motivated. The other set of contradictory narratives is that the economy is great and yet the economy is so weak that it needs a “jumbo” rate cut. Or, as Tho Bishop put it, we have “An Economy So Strong It Requires Crisis-Level Fed Action.”

Krugman has been writing out-of-touch articles for years now about how great the Biden economy is. He loves to point out that many economists thought that unemployment would rise when the Fed starting hiking rates in 2022 (even though he also said the rate hikes would cause a recession). But he also needs some sort of backing for his absurd recommendation, given the day before the FOMC decision was announced, that they should cut by up to 3 percentage points, six times the size of their “jumbo” half-point cut.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

In a crucial meeting held on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve convened to deliberate on its monetary policy amid ongoing economic challenges.

This would include not only traditional metrics like inflation and employment rates but also factors such as consumer confidence and global economic trends. “A more comprehensive approach will allow us to better gauge the overall health of the economy and make informed decisions that benefit all Americans,” he added.

economics_3.json,https://mises.org/friday-philosophy/explaining-imperialism,"Explaining Imperialism Imperialism and Social Classes

by Joseph Schumpeter; Meridian, 1951 x + 181 pp. Joseph Schumpeter, a contemporary and sometimes rival of Ludwig von Mises, agrees with Mises that capitalism leads to peace, not territorial expansion. The Marxist claim that imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism is thus mistaken. In “The Sociology of Imperialism” (1919), the first of the two essays included in this English translation, Schumpeter offers his own account of imperialism. He views imperialism during the capitalist era as a “social atavism” from earlier stages of history. His account has much to be said for it, but it is so restrictive in what counts as “imperialism” that it explains very little of the territorial expansion that took place in the period since capitalism came on the scene. In what follows, I’ll try to explain Schumpeter’s views, but the task is not altogether easy. Sometimes Schumpeter writes with great force, but often he includes so many qualifying comments and asides that the main line of his argument is difficult to discern. Schumpeter rightly notes that, in a world of complete free trade, there is no economic reason for control of foreign territories:

It may be stated as being beyond controversy that where free trade prevails no state is interested in forcible expansion as such. . .In a genuine state of free trade, foreign raw materials and foodstuffs are accessible to each nation, as though they were within its own territory. It might be objected that this is irrelevant to explaining imperialism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, because this was not a world of free trade, but Schumpeter responds that it remains true there was no general gain to the citizens of a particular nation through protective tariffs.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1. Joseph Schumpeter wrote about imperialism and social classes in 1951.  
2. Schumpeter thinks capitalism brings peace, not the need for more land.

4. Schumpeter calls imperialism a “social atavism” from earlier times.  
5. He believes his view of imperialism is too limited to explain all territorial expansions.  
6. Schumpeter sometimes writes clearly, but other times it’s hard to understand his main ideas.  
7. He says that free trade means no country wants to forcefully take more land.  
8. In a world of free trade, countries can get resources without controlling other places.

10. Schumpeter believes that protective tariffs do not really help the citizens of a nation.

10. He highlights the importance of political factors in shaping the landscape of imperialism.","**Schumpeter's Critique of Imperialism: A Technological and Political Perspective**

In a thought-provoking analysis, economist Joseph Schumpeter presents a compelling critique of traditional theories of imperialism, challenging long-held beliefs about its motivations and consequences. Schumpeter argues that many classical theories overlook the complex interplay of various factors that drive imperialist policies.

Central to Schumpeter’s argument is the assertion that technological advancements play a pivotal role in shaping imperialist strategies. He posits that innovations in technology not only facilitate the expansion of empires but also redefine the methods by which nations exert their influence over others. This technological lens allows for a deeper understanding of how imperialism evolves in response to changing industrial capabilities.

Moreover, Schumpeter highlights the social and economic inequalities that imperialism can engender within nations. As empires expand and exert control over foreign territories, the consequences often ripple back to the home country, exacerbating divisions between different social classes. He argues that the benefits of imperialism are unevenly distributed, leading to significant disparities in wealth and power among citizens.

In addition to economic factors, Schumpeter emphasizes the importance of political dynamics in shaping the landscape of imperialism. He asserts that political motivations—such as national security, prestige, and the desire for global influence—are crucial in understanding why nations pursue imperialist agendas. Without considering these political undercurrents, traditional theories of imperialism provide an incomplete picture.

Schumpeter’s insights urge a reevaluation of the motivations and impacts of imperialism, advocating for a more nuanced approach that incorporates technological, social, and political dimensions. His critique serves as a reminder of the complexities inherent in global power dynamics and the need for an interdisciplinary understanding of historical and contemporary imperialism.","1.

However, a deeper analysis of the policies and rhetoric of current presidential and vice-presidential candidates reveals a more complex reality. Using a framework of political analysis that considers attitudes towards private property rights, collectivization of consciousness, and wealth redistribution, it becomes evident that the United States is experiencing a gradual—but steady—shift towards the left. The Democratic Party: A Firm Commitment to Evolutionary Socialism

The Democratic Party, represented by Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, has openly embraced left-wing policies. Their platform reflects a strong commitment to government intervention in the economy, the promotion of collective societal goals, and a clear agenda for wealth redistribution. Private Property Rights and Wealth Redistribution

The Democratic platform advocates for significant regulation of private enterprises, particularly in sectors like healthcare, energy, and technology. However, these regulations lead to the violation of private property rights and free exchange, especially through the implementation of mandatory wealth redistribution policies at the state level. In essence, involuntary wealth redistribution acts as a subtle and gradual assault on private property rights. Under Harris and Walz, the Democrats strongly support wealth redistribution through progressive taxation, expanded social programs, and a higher minimum wage. Walz’s governance of Minnesota serves as a striking example of aggressive wealth redistribution, reminiscent of the policies of ardent socialists from the past. Currently, Minnesota has the most progressive tax policies in the US. Walz introduced a new global tax on multinational companies, imposed a 1% surtax on investment income over $1 million annually, and raised gas taxes.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

**Date: [Insert Date]**

As the 2024 election cycle heats up, the contrasting economic philosophies of the Democratic and Republican Parties are coming into sharper focus, with each side presenting distinct approaches to taxation, government spending, and essential public services.

The Democratic Party has long championed a progressive tax system aimed at reducing income inequality across the nation. Leaders within the party argue that higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans are necessary to fund vital social programs and ensure equitable access to resources. This includes calls for increased funding for education and healthcare, sectors they believe are critical to fostering long-term economic growth and improving the quality of life for all citizens. 

In stark contrast, the Republican Party advocates for a reduction in taxes as a means to stimulate economic growth. Party leaders argue that lower taxes will allow individuals and businesses to retain more of their earnings, which they contend will lead to increased investment and job creation. Additionally, Republicans emphasize the importance of cutting government spending, positioning it as a path to fiscal responsibility and economic efficiency.

National security remains a cornerstone of Republican policy, with an emphasis on maintaining a robust military presence both domestically and internationally. This focus is seen as essential to safeguarding the nation and promoting stability in a tumultuous global environment.

As the two parties prepare for the upcoming elections, voters will need to consider how these fundamental differences in economic policy align with their values and priorities for the future of the country. The debate over taxation, government spending, and the role of public services will undoubtedly shape the political landscape in the months to come. 

In this critical period, it is essential for citizens to engage with these issues, as they will have lasting implications on the nation's economic health and social fabric.","1. How is the American political landscape characterized in terms of left and right divisions?

According to a study by North Dakota State University, only a quarter of college students have a positive view of capitalism. Bernie Sanders was wildly popular in 2016, nearly dethroning the neoliberal Hillary Clinton, in part because of his disdain for “millionaires and billionaires” and “capitalism” in favor of socialism (though his views of “millionaires” changed once he became one!). As a sad response, proponents of free markets have fled from the term “capitalism” in favor of lukewarm terms like “market processes.”

Many may point to the popular coining of the term by French socialist Louis Blanc or Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as an example. Their argument has been that “capitalism is a term invented by our enemies and so we shouldn’t play into their paradigm.” But Mises, and the insights of the Austrian school, provide a picture why the term should be embraced rather than shunned or apologized for. Let’s start with what Mises himself says about the term “capitalism” in Human Action:

The system of free enterprise has been dubbed capitalism in order to deprecate and to smear it. However, this term can be considered very pertinent. It refers to the most characteristic feature of the system, its main eminence, viz. the role the notion of capital plays in its conduct. (emphasis added)

In an attempt to curry favor with the electorate, Vice President Kamala Harris recently declared support for price controls to combat high prices, which she attributes to supply chain issues and corporate greed. Today, it often seems that our country’s scope and knowledge of history is reduced to a few platitudes concerning markets that date back no further than the mid-1930’s, or perhaps the 1920’s. Inflation and currency debasement, however, go much further back. Furthermore, they are often accompanied by attempts to correct them with price controls. This has especially been the case with empires. In the past year, there was a meme of sorts, where women would be perplexed to find out just how often their husbands, when asked, reflected on the Roman Empire during the course of a week.

If we want to learn about currency debasement and price controls, I am of the opinion that we should be looking to the Third-Century Crisis. The Crisis of the Third Century was an approximately 50-year period during the Roman Empire, which lasted from 235-284 AD.

As the Roman Empire approached its twilight years, a confluence of economic challenges significantly threatened its stability and longevity. Analysts point to a series of factors that have culminated in what many are now calling an economic crisis of unprecedented proportions.

One of the most pressing issues facing the Empire is the alarming increase in government debt. This has been largely attributed to excessive spending on military endeavors and public welfare programs, which, while intended to bolster societal support and national security, have ultimately strained the imperial treasury. Economists warn that this unsustainable financial trajectory undermines the Empire's ability to respond effectively to both internal and external pressures.

Compounding these financial woes is Rome's increasing reliance on foreign goods and labor. This dependence has not only eroded the Empire's economic independence but has also left it vulnerable to external shocks, such as political instability in trade partner regions and disruptions in supply chains. Consequently, the once-thriving markets of Rome are now feeling the pinch, with local industries struggling to compete against cheaper imports.

Further exacerbating the situation, trade routes vital for commerce have faced significant disruptions. From banditry to political conflicts, these interruptions have led to a marked decline in both trade volume and revenue generation for the Empire. Merchants report dwindling profits, which in turn affect the livelihood of ordinary citizens and contribute to rising discontent across the provinces.

In summary, the Roman Empire's economic landscape is fraught with challenges that point towards a precarious future. Unless decisive action is taken to rein in spending, bolster local production, and secure trade routes, the Empire may find itself unable to sustain its grandeur, leaving its legacy at risk. The coming years will be crucial in determining whether Rome can navigate these turbulent waters or if it will succumb to the weight of its economic burdens.","1.

This was the largest cut to the target rate since March of 2020 in the midst of the Covid Panic. This cut comes after fourteen months of the FOMC holding the target rate at 5.5 percent. In late 2022, the FOMC was forced to allow interest rates to rise in response to mounting price inflation which hit a year-over-year growth rate of 8.9 percent in June 2022. Since the official CPI inflation rate fell back below five percent in Spring of 2023, however, there has been continuing speculation about a “Fed pivot” in which the Fed will once again begin a cycle of cuts to the target interest rate. This pivot finally came today, and more cuts are expected. According to the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections, most FOMC members report they believe the “appropriate target level” for the Federal funds rate will come in below 5.0 percent for 2024. This strongly suggests we should expect more rate cuts by the end of the year. This is all a clear signal that the Fed and FOMC believe the economic situation is worsening. For political reasons, however, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell continues to insist that this month’s big cut to the target rate is definitely, totally not in reaction to worsening economic data. During the post-FOMC press conference today, Fed Chaiman Jerome Powell repeatedly tried to take an upbeat tone about the state of the US economy explicitly stating—in his own words—”the US economy is in great shape” and “the labor market is in solid condition.”

Yet, if one looks closely, one will not find a case of the FOMC slashing the target interest rate by 50 basis points when the economy “is in great shape.” On the contrary, a 50 bps (or larger) cut to the target rate tends to come just a few months before recession and a rising unemployment rate.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

In a pivotal move aimed at bolstering economic activity, the central bank announced a significant interest rate cut on Wednesday. This decision marks the first reduction in over a year, signaling a shift in monetary policy as the institution seeks to provide much-needed support to consumers and businesses amid ongoing economic challenges.

The central bank's latest adjustment comes as inflationary pressures have begun to stabilize, allowing policymakers to recalibrate their approach. By lowering interest rates, the bank hopes to encourage borrowing and spending, which are critical components for driving growth in the current economic climate.

Officials from the central bank reaffirmed their commitment to achieving their inflation target, underscoring that this rate cut is part of a broader strategy to foster a resilient economic environment. ""We are dedicated to ensuring that our monetary policy remains conducive to sustainable economic growth while maintaining our focus on price stability,"" a central bank spokesperson stated during the announcement.

As the effects of this rate cut ripple through the economy, stakeholders will be closely monitoring its impact on consumer confidence and business investment, with the hope that this proactive measure will pave the way for a stronger economic recovery in the months ahead.","1.

In a significant move reflecting growing economic uncertainties, the Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday its decision to lower interest rates for the first time in several years. This unanimous decision, reached during the Fed's latest monetary policy meeting, underscores the central bank's responsiveness to a slowing economy that has raised alarms among policymakers.

The reduction in interest rates aims to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper for consumers and businesses. The Fed's action comes in response to a marked deceleration in economic growth, which has led to increased scrutiny of the current monetary policy landscape.

""Given the prevailing global economic uncertainties, we believe this adjustment will support our efforts to foster a stable economic environment,"" said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell during a post-meeting conference.

The reader may also be interested in studying the discussion of alternative systems, however, this article will focus only on describing the dominant system of the present. Open Market Operations and Fractional-Reserve Banking (FRB)

The central bank has a monopoly of issuing notes, that is, physical currency. The difference between the face value of the currency created and the cost to produce it is called seigniorage, and it gives a profit to the monetary sovereign, in this case the central bank. The notes of contemporary central banks aren’t redeemable in anything but themselves; they are created out of nothing by the fiat, or order, of the central bank itself. It is likely that physical currency produced by central banks will be partially replaced by central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the near future. These will perform many of the same functions as physical currency, and preserve features like seigniorage. Central banks are able to purchase assets from actors in the economy. They do this by writing a “check,” or demand deposit on themselves. These check are created out of nothing by fiat of the central bank, and are only redeemable in central bank notes. When the central bank purchases assets from regular banks using these checks (which are now electronic), the banks keep this money in reserve at their own accounts that they hold with the central bank.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

In today's rapidly changing financial environment, traditional banks and credit unions continue to play a pivotal role in the economy by accepting deposits and providing various lending options to consumers and businesses alike. Banks, being established financial institutions, offer services ranging from personal loans to complex investment products, catering to a diverse clientele.

In contrast, credit unions have emerged as member-owned financial cooperatives, prioritizing community and member benefits while delivering similar services to those offered by banks. This cooperative model not only fosters a sense of ownership among members but also often results in lower fees and better interest rates.

As technology advances, the banking sector is witnessing a significant transformation. The use of mobile banking applications has surged in recent years, allowing customers to conduct transactions, monitor accounts, and manage finances conveniently from their smartphones. This shift towards digital banking not only enhances customer experience but also increases financial accessibility for a broader audience.

An essential aspect of banking that often goes unnoticed is the process of money creation. Banks have the unique ability to lend more money than the total deposits they hold, a practice known as fractional reserve banking. This process allows for increased liquidity in the economy, enabling borrowers to access funds that can stimulate growth and investment.

As the banking landscape continues to evolve with technology and innovative financial models, both banks and credit unions must adapt to meet the changing needs of their customers while ensuring financial stability and security in an increasingly digital world.","1.

These disruptions have led to shortages of essential goods, ranging from electronics to food products, consequently fueling inflation rates. According to the latest reports, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has risen sharply, prompting concerns among consumers and policymakers alike.

Adding to the economic strain are labor shortages in key sectors such as manufacturing, transportation, and hospitality. These shortages have not only hindered production capabilities but have also resulted in increased wages as companies compete to attract and retain workers. This upward pressure on wages has further contributed to the inflationary environment, as businesses pass on the costs to consumers.

Economists are closely monitoring these inflation trends, recognizing that they could significantly influence upcoming monetary policy decisions by central banks. With interest rate adjustments and other monetary tools on the table, the response to inflation will be crucial in steering the global economy towards recovery.

As the world navigates these turbulent economic waters, the interplay between supply chains, labor markets, and inflation will be critical in shaping the future landscape of the global economy.","1. What myth does the Economics Policy Institute (EPI) promote regarding recent price inflation?

To understand these conflicting ideas, we must understand what prices, money, and interest are. First of all, prices are exchange-ratios between goods and/or services. An apple might be exchanged for a pear or two bananas. In that case we can conclude that the price of an apple, at that moment, is either one pear or two bananas. However, direct exchange has many disadvantages, and one of them is the price system. Expressing an apple’s price in pears and bananas doesn’t tell a dairy farmer or baker much about his product’s purchasing power. The exchange-ratios (prices) in a barter system are vast, specific, and ever-changing. Money solves this problem. Since money is a generally-accepted medium of exchange, it is also a common denominator in which we express prices. Suppose that an apple exchanges for $1 (e.g., 1/20th an ounce of gold). Given the above exchange-ratios (prices), a pear would also cost $1 whereas a banana would cost half a dollar. Thus, money prices help agents navigate and communicate better within the economy. When we have money prices of other goods, we also have a price of money. A seller of goods or services is a buyer of money and vice versa. Money purchases goods and goods purchase money. Therefore, the price of money is inverted to the price of goods and services. If the price of one apple is one dollar, then the price of one dollar is one apple.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

In today's intricate economic landscape, money serves as a fundamental pillar that underpins all transactions and financial activities. As societies have evolved, so too has the concept of money, which has transformed into various forms including cash, coins, digital currency, and credit systems. Each of these forms plays a crucial role in facilitating commerce and trade.

Money is not merely a medium of exchange; it also acts as a standard of deferred payment. This allows individuals and businesses to engage in transactions that span over time, making it possible to purchase goods and services now while planning to settle payments later. Such flexibility is indispensable in both personal finance and corporate dealings, as it fosters a smoother flow of goods and services.

Moreover, a well-functioning monetary system is vital for promoting economic growth and stability. When money circulates efficiently within an economy, it boosts consumer confidence and drives spending. This, in turn, encourages investment and innovation, creating a cycle that further supports economic development.

As we navigate the complexities of contemporary financial systems, understanding the multifaceted role of money is essential. Its various forms not only facilitate daily transactions but also contribute to the overall health of the economy, demonstrating that money is indeed an essential component of modern economies.","1.

In a democratic society, the right to free speech stands as a cornerstone for fostering the exchange of ideas. This fundamental liberty not only empowers individuals to express their thoughts but also encourages a vibrant marketplace of ideas where differing perspectives can coexist. 

The ability for people to question and challenge prevailing opinions is essential. Without this mechanism, societies risk stagnation, as innovation and creativity often thrive in an environment where diverse viewpoints are welcomed and debated. History has shown that many breakthroughs in various fields—be it science, technology, or the arts—arise from the willingness to interrogate established norms and explore alternative solutions.

Moreover, open dialogue is critical for addressing and resolving pressing societal issues. When citizens engage in constructive conversations, they can confront challenges head-on, working collaboratively to find solutions that reflect the diverse needs of the community. Limiting this exchange can not only hinder societal progress but also create an atmosphere of fear and conformity, ultimately undermining the very fabric of democracy.

Therefore, prices signal people what not to buy better than a surrogate decision-maker. As a customer, when I make a voluntary purchase and pay the cooperative seller, I am not just buying goods. I am making a claim on those goods—a legal claim that I did something for someone else and they paid me for the work they performed at some past date.

The Federal Reserve seems to have finally committed to, but has not yet begun its “rate cutting cycle” of lower interest rates, specifically the Federal Funds Rate, or policy rate.

*By [Your Name], Staff Writer*

The Federal Reserve's monetary policy has become a focal point of discussion among economists and policymakers alike as the central bank grapples with rising inflation rates. Over the past year, the Federal Reserve has implemented a series of interest rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation and stabilizing the economy. 

Despite these measures, some members of the Federal Reserve are beginning to believe that inflation may be showing signs of subsiding. This optimism, however, is tempered by concerns regarding the broader implications of sustained high interest rates on consumers and businesses. Many experts warn that the rising rates could hinder economic growth, leading to a potential slowdown in spending and investment.

Analysts suggest that a strategic cut in interest rates could provide a much-needed stimulus to the economy, particularly as the effects of previous rate changes often take time to materialize. A more stable yield curve, which indicates a healthy economic outlook, could encourage increased lending and investment. In contrast, an inverted yield curve—a situation where short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates—has historically signaled looming recessions, having preceded every recession in the past 50 years.

Financial markets are closely watching the Federal Reserve's signals regarding potential future interest rate adjustments. As economists monitor the situation for signs of economic recovery, the tension between combating inflation and fostering growth remains a critical point of concern.

economics_19.json,https://mises.org/mises-wire/ruling-elites-create-orwellian-reinterpretation-human-rights,"The Ruling Elites Create an Orwellian Reinterpretation of Human Rights Ludwig von Mises depicts the aim of revolutionary socialism as: “to clear the ground for building up a new civilization by liquidating the old one.” One of the main strategies in liquidating a civilization involves dismantling its legal and philosophical foundations. This role is fulfilled by activists who embark upon “sabotage and revolution” by subverting the meaning of words: “The socialists have engineered a semantic revolution in converting the meaning of terms into their opposite.”

George Orwell famously called this subversive language “Newspeak.” Peter Foster describes Newspeak as “a sort of totalitarian Esperanto that sought gradually to diminish the range of what was thinkable by eliminating, contracting, and manufacturing words.”

Mises explains that dictators express their ideas in Newspeak precisely because, if they did not, nobody would support their schemes:

This reversal of the traditional connotation of all words of the political terminology is not merely a peculiarity of the language of the Russian Communists and their Fascist and Nazi disciples. The social order that in abolishing private property deprives the consumers of their autonomy and independence, and thereby subjects every man to the arbitrary discretion of the central planning board, could not win the support of the masses if they were not to camouflage its main character. The socialists would have never duped the voters if they had openly told them that their ultimate end is to cast them into bondage. (emphasis added)

In the proliferation of Newspeak, the reinterpretation of “human rights” has proved to be one of the most powerful weapons of sabotage and revolution. Activists have seized control of a vast empire of international law, NGOs, and human rights charities with a global network of staff who monitor respect for “human rights.” They wield their significant influence in the human rights industry to undermine human liberty by redefining the meaning of “human rights” to denote the antidiscrimination principle.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

In the landscape of political change, revolutionary movements often rise as a direct response to entrenched social and economic inequalities. These movements, driven by a desire for justice, seek to establish a society rooted in equality and communal ownership, fundamentally challenging the status quo.

Historically, many revolutionary groups have aimed to dismantle existing governments and systems that perpetuate inequality. Their objectives frequently include radical reforms in laws and policies that govern society, reflecting a profound shift in the political paradigm. However, the path to revolution is often fraught with complexities, particularly regarding the rhetoric employed by those in power.

Authoritarian regimes, in their quest to maintain control, frequently resort to the manipulation of language. This tactic not only limits freedom of thought and expression but also shapes public perception through carefully crafted propaganda. Such strategies can lead to widespread misunderstanding and manipulation of the populace, further entrenching the power of those in control.

Critics of these practices argue vehemently that they undermine the very foundations of democracy and individual rights. The implications of this manipulation extend beyond mere political discourse; they threaten the essence of free expression and the ability of citizens to engage in informed decision-making.

In this turbulent environment, journalists and activists emerge as vital players. They are tasked with exposing the abuses of power that arise from such manipulative practices, advocating for reform and transparency. Through their reporting, they shine a light on the injustices that fuel revolutionary fervor, thereby empowering the public to challenge the narratives constructed by those in authority.

As the struggle for equality continues, the role of language remains a powerful tool in political discourse, capable of both uniting and dividing societies. The challenge lies in harnessing this power to foster genuine dialogue and promote the rights of all individuals, ensuring that the promise of a more equitable society is not just a revolutionary dream, but a shared reality.","1.

Through cronyism, slaveholders consistently had to seek assistance from the legal system in order to socialize and enforce slavery. The enforcement costs for keeping slaves slaves would have been too high for the minority slaveholding elite to maintain slavery, beyond their own strength or what they could afford to hire. Lord Mansfield, a British judge, argued the following in a case called Somerset v Stewart (1772), which involved his refusal to forcibly send an enslaved person on English soil over to Jamaica to be sold,
