He has raised the bidding for votes with a preposterous new interventionist proposal of his own—a plan to boost fertility rates by turning in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments into a free service, to be paid for by a combination of government subsidies and mandates on health insurers. Traditionally, advocacy of IVF subsidies has been a staple of the same groups on the “progressive” side of the culture wars that have championed government-subsidized abortions on demand, like the Center for Reproductive Rights. According to data from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, representing over 95 percent of IVF clinics in America, 390,000 IVF cycles were performed in 2022, which led to 91,771 births. The current cost of IVF and related procedures ranges from $15,000 to $30,000 per IVF cycle, making total current expenditures on the order of $8 billion per year. Murray Rothbard’s theoretical analysis of the economics of “free” services and the incidence of government-imposed extortion implies that the costs of providing IVF treatments for “free” could be far, far higher. There are estimates that only a quarter of those who desire IVF treatments can actually afford them at current prices, so artificially reducing the price paid by patients to zero might mean at least a four-fold increase in the number of IVF cycles administered. It might even mean more if clinics (which would also have no incentive to control costs) encourage a greater number of cycles per patient to increase the chances of achieving a successful pregnancy.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03
economics_2.json,https://mises.org/power-market/three-contradictions-krugmans-take-rate-cuts,"Three Contradictions in Krugman’s Take on the Rate Cuts Paul Krugman’s latest column is all over the place. He was trying to provide commentary on the Fed’s half-point cut in the Federal Funds Rate, but he was juggling too many contradictory narratives. The contradictions start at the beginning. The Fed’s decision “was of minimal importance” but also a “momentous move.” It wasn’t important because it just a small change in the overnight interbank interest rate. It was very important because of its effect on other interest rates and because the Fed has “declared its belief that the war on inflation has been won.” Maybe Krugman was going for the antithesis literary device, like Neil Armstrong’s “small step for man, giant leap for mankind.” Maybe he wanted to downplay any immediate suspicions that such a large cut a few weeks before the presidential election would be politically motivated. The other set of contradictory narratives is that the economy is great and yet the economy is so weak that it needs a “jumbo” rate cut. Or, as Tho Bishop put it, we have “An Economy So Strong It Requires Crisis-Level Fed Action.”

Krugman has been writing out-of-touch articles for years now about how great the Biden economy is. He loves to point out that many economists thought that unemployment would rise when the Fed starting hiking rates in 2022 (even though he also said the rate hikes would cause a recession). But he also needs some sort of backing for his absurd recommendation, given the day before the FOMC decision was announced, that they should cut by up to 3 percentage points, six times the size of their “jumbo” half-point cut.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03
economics_3.json,https://mises.org/friday-philosophy/explaining-imperialism,"Explaining Imperialism Imperialism and Social Classes

by Joseph Schumpeter; Meridian, 1951 x + 181 pp. Joseph Schumpeter, a contemporary and sometimes rival of Ludwig von Mises, agrees with Mises that capitalism leads to peace, not territorial expansion. The Marxist claim that imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism is thus mistaken. In “The Sociology of Imperialism” (1919), the first of the two essays included in this English translation, Schumpeter offers his own account of imperialism. He views imperialism during the capitalist era as a “social atavism” from earlier stages of history. His account has much to be said for it, but it is so restrictive in what counts as “imperialism” that it explains very little of the territorial expansion that took place in the period since capitalism came on the scene. In what follows, I’ll try to explain Schumpeter’s views, but the task is not altogether easy. Sometimes Schumpeter writes with great force, but often he includes so many qualifying comments and asides that the main line of his argument is difficult to discern. Schumpeter rightly notes that, in a world of complete free trade, there is no economic reason for control of foreign territories:

It may be stated as being beyond controversy that where free trade prevails no state is interested in forcible expansion as such. . .In a genuine state of free trade, foreign raw materials and foodstuffs are accessible to each nation, as though they were within its own territory. It might be objected that this is irrelevant to explaining imperialism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, because this was not a world of free trade, but Schumpeter responds that it remains true there was no general gain to the citizens of a particular nation through protective tariffs.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

However, a deeper analysis of the policies and rhetoric of current presidential and vice-presidential candidates reveals a more complex reality. Using a framework of political analysis that considers attitudes towards private property rights, collectivization of consciousness, and wealth redistribution, it becomes evident that the United States is experiencing a gradual—but steady—shift towards the left. The Democratic Party: A Firm Commitment to Evolutionary Socialism

The Democratic Party, represented by Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, has openly embraced left-wing policies. Their platform reflects a strong commitment to government intervention in the economy, the promotion of collective societal goals, and a clear agenda for wealth redistribution. Private Property Rights and Wealth Redistribution

The Democratic platform advocates for significant regulation of private enterprises, particularly in sectors like healthcare, energy, and technology. However, these regulations lead to the violation of private property rights and free exchange, especially through the implementation of mandatory wealth redistribution policies at the state level. In essence, involuntary wealth redistribution acts as a subtle and gradual assault on private property rights. Under Harris and Walz, the Democrats strongly support wealth redistribution through progressive taxation, expanded social programs, and a higher minimum wage. Walz’s governance of Minnesota serves as a striking example of aggressive wealth redistribution, reminiscent of the policies of ardent socialists from the past. Currently, Minnesota has the most progressive tax policies in the US. Walz introduced a new global tax on multinational companies, imposed a 1% surtax on investment income over $1 million annually, and raised gas taxes.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

According to a study by North Dakota State University, only a quarter of college students have a positive view of capitalism. Bernie Sanders was wildly popular in 2016, nearly dethroning the neoliberal Hillary Clinton, in part because of his disdain for “millionaires and billionaires” and “capitalism” in favor of socialism (though his views of “millionaires” changed once he became one!). As a sad response, proponents of free markets have fled from the term “capitalism” in favor of lukewarm terms like “market processes.”

Many may point to the popular coining of the term by French socialist Louis Blanc or Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as an example. Their argument has been that “capitalism is a term invented by our enemies and so we shouldn’t play into their paradigm.” But Mises, and the insights of the Austrian school, provide a picture why the term should be embraced rather than shunned or apologized for. Let’s start with what Mises himself says about the term “capitalism” in Human Action:

The system of free enterprise has been dubbed capitalism in order to deprecate and to smear it. However, this term can be considered very pertinent. It refers to the most characteristic feature of the system, its main eminence, viz. the role the notion of capital plays in its conduct. (emphasis added)

It appears that Mises is favorable towards the term. In fact, a simple CTRL+F search through Human Action shows that the term is used 213 times, including sections specifically defending the system.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

In an attempt to curry favor with the electorate, Vice President Kamala Harris recently declared support for price controls to combat high prices, which she attributes to supply chain issues and corporate greed. Today, it often seems that our country’s scope and knowledge of history is reduced to a few platitudes concerning markets that date back no further than the mid-1930’s, or perhaps the 1920’s. Inflation and currency debasement, however, go much further back. Furthermore, they are often accompanied by attempts to correct them with price controls. This has especially been the case with empires. In the past year, there was a meme of sorts, where women would be perplexed to find out just how often their husbands, when asked, reflected on the Roman Empire during the course of a week. The men might even mention the Colosseum, the aqueducts, or Caesar’s conquest of Gaul to state what in particular they thought about when thinking upon Rome. If we want to learn about currency debasement and price controls, I am of the opinion that we should be looking to the Third-Century Crisis. The Crisis of the Third Century was an approximately 50-year period during the Roman Empire, which lasted from 235-284 AD. Among the many problems that Rome would face during this period was a currency debasement. This devaluation of their currency was achieved through reducing the amount of silver in the Roman denarius. The Romans spent more than they could afford, as is often the case of empires.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

This was the largest cut to the target rate since March of 2020 in the midst of the Covid Panic. This cut comes after fourteen months of the FOMC holding the target rate at 5.5 percent. In late 2022, the FOMC was forced to allow interest rates to rise in response to mounting price inflation which hit a year-over-year growth rate of 8.9 percent in June 2022. Since the official CPI inflation rate fell back below five percent in Spring of 2023, however, there has been continuing speculation about a “Fed pivot” in which the Fed will once again begin a cycle of cuts to the target interest rate. This pivot finally came today, and more cuts are expected. According to the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections, most FOMC members report they believe the “appropriate target level” for the Federal funds rate will come in below 5.0 percent for 2024. This strongly suggests we should expect more rate cuts by the end of the year. This is all a clear signal that the Fed and FOMC believe the economic situation is worsening. For political reasons, however, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell continues to insist that this month’s big cut to the target rate is definitely, totally not in reaction to worsening economic data. During the post-FOMC press conference today, Fed Chaiman Jerome Powell repeatedly tried to take an upbeat tone about the state of the US economy explicitly stating—in his own words—”the US economy is in great shape” and “the labor market is in solid condition.”

Yet, if one looks closely, one will not find a case of the FOMC slashing the target interest rate by 50 basis points when the economy “is in great shape.” On the contrary, a 50 bps (or larger) cut to the target rate tends to come just a few months before recession and a rising unemployment rate.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

The Fed’s actions are best understood as acknowledging the obvious: the regime has been gaslighting the public about the economy. Despite the constant assistance from the Biden-Harris Administration and their reliable allies in the media that the economy is strong, today’s Fed action was a crisis-level response. What changed? The job market is an obvious one. Once the go-to argument for the strength of the American economy, official numbers show there are now fewer full-time jobs in America than there were a year ago. This follows significant revisions to jobs reports that overstated almost a million jobs. Of course, at the same time the Fed still continues to battle inflation that is well beyond its 2 percent target, with assets like housing, food prices, and stocks still at significant highs. Have no fear, though; Chairman Jerome Powell assured the American economy is still “strong overall.” To further this point, the Fed pushed its go-to propaganda, with a variety of forecasts predicting that inflation will continue to go down, unemployment will continue to fall, and that all will be down.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03
economics_9.json,https://mises.org/mises-wire/understanding-basics-modern-banking,"Understanding the Basics of Modern Banking The monetary and banking system plays an incredibly important role in contemporary economies. Knowledge of how this system functions should therefore be spread as widely as possible, yet the education system barely instructs its students about this subject, if indeed it instructs them about it at all. This article aims to contribute to bridging this gap by giving a basic overview of how the system of money creation and banking works today. The reader may also be interested in studying the discussion of alternative systems, however, this article will focus only on describing the dominant system of the present. Open Market Operations and Fractional-Reserve Banking (FRB)

The central bank has a monopoly of issuing notes, that is, physical currency. The difference between the face value of the currency created and the cost to produce it is called seigniorage, and it gives a profit to the monetary sovereign, in this case the central bank. The notes of contemporary central banks aren’t redeemable in anything but themselves; they are created out of nothing by the fiat, or order, of the central bank itself. It is likely that physical currency produced by central banks will be partially replaced by central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the near future. These will perform many of the same functions as physical currency, and preserve features like seigniorage. Central banks are able to purchase assets from actors in the economy. They do this by writing a “check,” or demand deposit on themselves. These check are created out of nothing by fiat of the central bank, and are only redeemable in central bank notes. When the central bank purchases assets from regular banks using these checks (which are now electronic), the banks keep this money in reserve at their own accounts that they hold with the central bank.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

Can you understand how it can be that the Federal Reserve, the world’s greatest and by far most important central bank, has now lost the astounding sum of $193 billion? If not, you are surely not alone. Since September 2022, the Fed has lost money every month. These unprecedented losses continue, and this fall they will in the aggregate pass $200 billion. The Fed has a powerful mystique, which it works hard at cultivating. It intensely wants to be credible—that is, for you to believe in it (“credo” = I believe), and perhaps you do. The people’s belief is an important source of the Fed’s power, and its power is a key source of the government’s power. We can accurately say that the Fed prints power by printing money. The Fed does not want little things like $200 billion in losses to shake your belief—like the Wizard of Oz, it tells you, “Pay no attention to that man, or those losses, behind the curtain!” It puts its losses behind an accounting curtain that pretends that losses are an asset. These operating losses are not, as is sometimes mistakenly said, mere “paper” losses. They are real, cash losses. The Fed is suffering negative net interest income because its cost of funds is much greater than the income on its investments. The $193 billion in operating losses exceeds the Fed’s $43 billion in total capital by more than four times.

The former president was golfing when Secret Service agents spotted a rifle barrel poking out of some bushes just off the course, near a hole Trump would soon play. Agents fired on the suspect, causing him to flee as Trump was rushed off the course. Shortly after, the man was apprehended by police. A scoped rifle, two backpacks, and a video camera were recovered from the woods where the suspect was hiding. The FBI said it was investigating the incident as an attempted assassination. The suspect, Ryan Routh, has so far been charged with two gun-related crimes. While there are clearly some major differences between this incident and the first assassination attempt in July—when Trump was shot in the ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania—the fact that an armed man was able to get so close to the former president and remain undetected until the last moment for the second time in two months is a big deal. Yet the reaction from the political establishment and the establishment media has been notably different. Back in July, there was broad agreement within the establishment that they needed to “lower the temperature.” This week, the rhetoric has changed. While most go through the motion of denouncing political violence, establishment figures and outlets have downplayed the assassination attempt, obscured the attempted shooter’s political ideology, and even blamed Trump himself for provoking people into trying to kill him.

Additionally, global debt surged by over $15 trillion in 2023, reaching a new record high of $313 trillion. Around 55% of this rise came from developed economies, mainly the U.S., France, and Germany. Unfunded liabilities in the United States amount to $72 trillion, almost 300% of GDP. This may seem high until you look at Spain with 500% of GDP, France with close to 400%, or Germany with close to 350% of GDP. There is no escape from debt. Paying for the government’s fictitious promises in paper money will result in a constantly depreciating currency, thereby impoverishing those who earn a wage or have savings. Inflation is the hidden tax, and it is very convenient for governments because they always blame shops or businesses and present themselves as the solution by printing even more currency. Governments want more inflation to reduce the impact of the enormous debt and unfunded liabilities in real terms. They know they can’t tax you more, so they will tax you indirectly by destroying the purchasing power of the currency they issue. High taxes are not a tool to reduce high debt, but rather to perpetuate the expropriation of national wealth. Countries with high taxes and big governments also have enormous public debt levels. If you thought the monetary destruction we have witnessed in recent years was excessive, just wait for the suffering we will endure in the future.

Milei has demonstrated this with a variety of overtures toward the State of Israel and by his repeated meetings with the dictator of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This all positions Burenos Aires as a reliable supplicant and friend of Washington. Or, as I summed it up back in June:

[Milei] displays no particular affinity for anti-interventionist foreign policy, and he’s certainly no threat to the established US-dominated geopolitical order. Milei is, and will likely continue to be, a reliable ally of the American security state. More succinctly, we might say that Milei is a “CIA-approved head of state.”

It should be noted that there is no reason why Milei is required to take these positions. Milei could easily stake out a position making Argentina a “non-aligned” country that refuses to participate in US and NATO meddling in Eastern Europe. Milei’s regime could easily choose to not take a position in the multiplying conflicts between Washington-Tel Aviv and half a dozen other states. After all, Buenos Aires is 12,000 km (7,600 mi) from Tel Aviv, and it is nearly 13,000 km (7,900 mi) from Kyiv. The idea that Buenos Aires must choose a side in either of these two conflicts is absurd. Moreover, Argentina has a small economy and is an economic basket case so, frankly, the Argentinian military is tactically irrelevant to any global conflict.

economics_15.json,https://mises.org/mises-wire/why-interest-rates-are-not-price-money,"Why Interest Rates Are Not the Price of Money According to mainstream economics, interest rates are the price of money, but the Austrian school says differently. To understand these conflicting ideas, we must understand what prices, money, and interest are. First of all, prices are exchange-ratios between goods and/or services. An apple might be exchanged for a pear or two bananas. In that case we can conclude that the price of an apple, at that moment, is either one pear or two bananas. However, direct exchange has many disadvantages, and one of them is the price system. Expressing an apple’s price in pears and bananas doesn’t tell a dairy farmer or baker much about his product’s purchasing power. The exchange-ratios (prices) in a barter system are vast, specific, and ever-changing. Money solves this problem. Since money is a generally-accepted medium of exchange, it is also a common denominator in which we express prices. Suppose that an apple exchanges for $1 (e.g., 1/20th an ounce of gold). Given the above exchange-ratios (prices), a pear would also cost $1 whereas a banana would cost half a dollar. Thus, money prices help agents navigate and communicate better within the economy. When we have money prices of other goods, we also have a price of money. A seller of goods or services is a buyer of money and vice versa. Money purchases goods and goods purchase money. Therefore, the price of money is inverted to the price of goods and services. If the price of one apple is one dollar, then the price of one dollar is one apple.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

As the great Ludwig von Mises points out, “Opium and morphine are certainly dangerous, habit-forming drugs. But once the principle is admitted that it is the duty of government to protect the individual against his own foolishness, no serious objections can be advanced against further encroachments. A good case could be made out in favor of the prohibition of alcohol and nicotine. And why limit the government’s benevolent providence to the protection of the individual’s body only? Is not the harm a man can inflict on his mind and soul even more disastrous than any bodily evils? Why not prevent him from reading bad books and seeing bad plays, from looking at bad paintings and statues and from hearing bad music? The mischief done by bad ideologies, surely, is much more pernicious, both for the individual and for the whole society, than that done by narcotic drugs. These fears are not merely imaginary specters terrifying secluded doctrinaires. It is a fact that no paternal government, whether ancient or modern, ever shrank from regimenting its subjects’ minds, beliefs, and opinions.

We have a price system that does that for us, so why are the customer-surrogates swarming in to take down the customer when the market signals to customers what’s in their best interest? As Thomas Sowell said in the book Basic Economics:

The self-rationing created by prices not only tends to mean less social and political friction but also more economic efficiency, since each individual knows his or her own preferences better than any third party can. Therefore, prices signal people what not to buy better than a surrogate decision-maker. As a customer, when I make a voluntary purchase and pay the cooperative seller, I am not just buying goods. I am making a claim on those goods—a legal claim that I did something for someone else and they paid me for the work they performed at some past date.

The Federal Reserve seems to have finally committed to, but has not yet begun its “rate cutting cycle” of lower interest rates, specifically the Federal Funds Rate, or policy rate. This lines up well with what I have been thinking and saying here and elsewhere; the Fed was not likely to cut rates until the fall of 2024 or later. My thinking or guessing was based on the notion that the Fed wanted to remain perceived as tough on inflation for as long as possible and that they wanted to be perceived—eventually—as coming to the economy’s rescue, rather than just goosing the stock market higher. The Fed plays a “confidence game” with the general public. More importantly, in my thinking, the rate cuts would line up well with and reinforce the un-inversion of the interest rate yield curve. Now, with the Fed’s Chairman Jay Powell fully making intentions known at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming Fed Conference, and market expectations now in full adjustment, the inverted yield curve is poised to pop! You can see in the graph, it seems inevitable that short term rates (2-year government bonds) will fall below long-term rates (10-year government bonds). You can also see that this inverted yield curve cycle is the most severe and long-lasting inversion since the late 1970s. As I remember it, that previous cycle was one of relative impoverishment for Americans, economic distress, unemployment and inflation, and more to come (the term Stagflation was coined in the 1960s in the UK) and one of the worse decades in stock market history in inflation-adjusted terms.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

This role is fulfilled by activists who embark upon “sabotage and revolution” by subverting the meaning of words: “The socialists have engineered a semantic revolution in converting the meaning of terms into their opposite.”

George Orwell famously called this subversive language “Newspeak.” Peter Foster describes Newspeak as “a sort of totalitarian Esperanto that sought gradually to diminish the range of what was thinkable by eliminating, contracting, and manufacturing words.”

Mises explains that dictators express their ideas in Newspeak precisely because, if they did not, nobody would support their schemes:

This reversal of the traditional connotation of all words of the political terminology is not merely a peculiarity of the language of the Russian Communists and their Fascist and Nazi disciples. The social order that in abolishing private property deprives the consumers of their autonomy and independence, and thereby subjects every man to the arbitrary discretion of the central planning board, could not win the support of the masses if they were not to camouflage its main character. The socialists would have never duped the voters if they had openly told them that their ultimate end is to cast them into bondage. (emphasis added)

In the proliferation of Newspeak, the reinterpretation of “human rights” has proved to be one of the most powerful weapons of sabotage and revolution. Activists have seized control of a vast empire of international law, NGOs, and human rights charities with a global network of staff who monitor respect for “human rights.” They wield their significant influence in the human rights industry to undermine human liberty by redefining the meaning of “human rights” to denote the antidiscrimination principle.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

Lord Mansfield, a British judge, argued the following in a case called Somerset v Stewart (1772), which involved his refusal to forcibly send an enslaved person on English soil over to Jamaica to be sold,

The state of slavery is of such a nature, that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political; but only positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory: it’s so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law. (emphasis added)

Positive law, according to Mansfield, was the only thing that could be said to maintain slavery. Slavery, of course, would still exist to an extent without positive law enforcing it, but it is much-weakened without the force of positive law from the state (at taxpayer expense). Besides examining the policies that socialized, enforced, and maintained slavery, we can also—with the help of Mises—come to understand the praxeology involved in slavery and why slaveholders are prone to seek the help of the state.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03
