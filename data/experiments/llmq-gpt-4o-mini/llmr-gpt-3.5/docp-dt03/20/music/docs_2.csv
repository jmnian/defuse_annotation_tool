It’s called Wholesome Evil Fantasy, and its tracks are appropriately titled “Wholesome,” “Evil,” and “Fantasy.” Listen to it below.

“These songs come from the spiciest, most goofy, glitter gloss place in my psyche. I wasn’t really thinking very hard when I wrote them. I was just having so much fun.” De Souza said of Wholesome Evil Fantasy EP in press materials. She continued:

I am continuously inspired by the sounds and energy brought by my collaborators, Elliott Kozel and Jesse Schuster. They are always making me laugh and bringing out the silliest version of me. I would not have discovered this new space without them. Listening to these songs fills me with gratitude for the playful musical connection we have, as well as everlasting friendship. My baseline existence can be pretty heavy and complicated, but these songs made me deeply joyous the whole time I was working on them.

De Souza is throwing two dance parties to celebrate the new EP. The first will occur in Los Angeles, on October 3, with the other taking place in De Souza’s hometown of Asheville, North Carolina, on October 8.

Both records have been remastered by Heba Kadry, and will be available on vinyl, CD, and digital streaming platforms. “Revisiting work from the past is a double-edged sword for me. Of course, it’s bound to happen when you've been making music for 60 years or so,” Cale said of the reissues in a press release. He continued:

What’s unique about this process with Domino, is their desire to get it right. Not merely reissue something for the sake of an anniversary or racking up a catalogue favorite—but finding new treasures and highlighting what made it special in the first place. After hearing the test pressings, it occurred to me that the new mastering was a major part of how these works will be presented, rather than simply being preserved. There are moments of clarity and even a laugh or two had by revisiting not only the music, but recalling the sessions (and antics) that made up what became these two recordings. It is my pleasure to share these with you… again. Cale recorded The Academy in Peril and Paris 1919 not long after he relocated from New York to Los Angeles, following his departure from the Velvet Underground. The two LPs marked Cale’s only solo albums on Reprise; his solo debut, 1970’s Vintage Violence, was issued on Columbia. The Academy in Peril cost Warner Bros. a whopping $120,000, and featured the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, so things got scaled back a bit for Paris 1919.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

In the clip, two people embark on an adventure on a grassy mountain while Heynderickx sings and whittles a stick. Watch it below.

The long-awaited follow-up to Heynderickx’s 2018 debut full-length, I Need to Start a Garden, was led by the July single “Seed of a Seed.” While that song was about reclaiming your time, “Foxglove” looks forward to dream of an easygoing future. “[It’s] my daydream tune craving a slower and simpler pace of life,” she explained. “Sometimes it all feels so far away—living in a city being so removed from a life entwined with nature.”

Lyrically, Seed of a Seed centers around the ways in which we’ve distanced ourselves from nature in a world of technology and overconsumption. Joining Heynderickx to flesh out the album’s compositions are drummer Daniel Rossi, trombone player Denzel Mendoza, and bassist Matthew Holmes, with additional parts by electric guitarist William Seiji Marsh and cellist Caleigh Drane.

In one instance, he claimed Marr “ignored” an offer for a 2025 tour. He later claimed that Marr “blocked” a Smiths greatest-hits album. And, most recently, he asserted that Marr obtained the trademark rights to the Smiths’ name “without any consultation to Morrissey, and without allowing Morrissey the standard opportunity of ‘objection.’”

Marr, through his management, has now responded to Morrissey’s various allegations. Find it in full below. Regarding the Smiths trademark, Marr’s management said that, in 2018, “Marr reached out to Morrissey, via his representatives, to work together in protecting The Smiths’ name.” Morrissey apparently did not respond to Marr, which led the latter musician “to register the trademark himself.”

Regarding a compilation album, Marr verified Morrissey’s account, explaining that he declined Warner Music Group’s offer to release a greatest-hits album “given the number already in existence.”

Most crucially for Smiths fans, Marr also confirmed that a reunion tour was offered to him: “I didn’t ignore the offer,” Marr wrote, “I said no.”

The Smiths broke up in 1987, and Johnny Marr and Morrissey have had numerous disputes in the ensuing years. Nevertheless, the idea of a reunion has been on the table in the past, with Marr revealing in his 2016 memoir, Set the Boy Free, that he discussed the possibility of reuniting with Morrissey in 2008.
