The way the explosive material was integrated into the battery pack made it extremely difficult to detect, the source said.

Hundreds of walkie-talkies used by the group exploded on Wednesday, a day after thousands of Hezbollah's pagers detonated across the group's strongholds in Lebanon.

Pictures of the walkie-talkies that had exploded showed labels reading ""ICOM"" and ""made in Japan"". Icom has said it halted production a decade ago of the radio models identified in the attack, and that most of those still on sale were counterfeit.

Yoshiki Enomoto, the general manager of Icom's security and trade division, told Reuters it was possible that an older Icom device had been modified to make a bomb.

It would be difficult to insert an explosive device into the main compartment of the walkie-talkie because its electronics are tightly packed, so it was more likely to have been in the detachable battery pack, Enomoto told the Japanese broadcaster Fuji TV.

The Lebanese source said explosions had occurred even in cases where the battery pack was separated from the rest of the device.

A Lebanese security source had earlier told Reuters that the pagers had been implanted with explosives that were difficult to detect. Another security source told Reuters that up to three grams (0.11 ounce) of explosives had been hidden in the new pagers, apparently months before the blasts.

*Date: October 23, 2023*

In a troubling development, a series of recent attacks attributed to Hezbollah have prompted heightened alarms among security agencies in the region. Investigators have uncovered that operatives associated with the militant group have been using modified walkie-talkies in various operations, which poses a significant threat to public safety.

The modified devices, originally designed for communication, have been ingeniously repurposed to conceal explosives. This strategic alteration enhances the effectiveness of their operations, making it increasingly difficult for authorities to detect and neutralize these threats. Experts assert that the sophistication of these modifications signifies a notable advancement in Hezbollah's tactical capabilities.

Concerns have been raised regarding the counterfeit walkie-talkies, many of which lack the essential safety features of genuine products. The modifications are not only complex but also challenging to identify, increasing the risk they pose in public areas.

In response to this alarming trend, security agencies are actively working to identify and neutralize these modified devices, emphasizing the urgent need for vigilance in safeguarding public spaces. As investigations continue, authorities are calling for increased awareness regarding the safety of communication devices, urging citizens to report any suspicious activity.

In a shocking incident that has reverberated around the globe, forty-three students from Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College have been reported missing after being forcibly disappeared by local police in Iguala, Guerrero. The event, which has come to be known as the Ayotzinapa case, occurred on the night of September 26, 2014, when the students were allegedly targeted during a protest against the government's educational policies.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Days after a shooter attacked an interstate and disappeared, leaving a Kentucky community scared and on guard, Fred and Sheila McCoy decided to lace up their boots for the first time in a long time and spend days in rugged terrain searching until, finally, they found a body. Kentucky State Police credited Fred and Sheila McCoy, who typically spend their retired days creating YouTube videos about the Hatfield-McCoy feud, with helping investigators find what they believe are the remains of Joseph Couch. Couch, 32, is suspected of firing randomly at vehicles on Interstate 75 on Sept. 7, wounding five people. The person believed to be Couch died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, said Kentucky’s Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. William Ralston. A soft tissue DNA test was inconclusive on the identification of the body, and testing on the bones could take up to two days, Ralston said. A toxicology test is also pending. Teams of local, state and federal law enforcement had searched tens of thousands of acres of woods since the shooting. Authorities warned residents to be extra vigilant and some schools temporarily shifted to virtual learning. “For one week we turned into bounty hunters,” Fred McCoy told The Associated Press on Thursday.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

Zoo admits that their pandas are ‘painted dogs’ after backlash from visitors

A Chinese zoo has admitted that the pandas in their exhibits were, in fact, “painted dogs.”

According to the New York Post, visitors at the Shanwei Zoo realized they were being bamboozled when the so-called pandas began panting and barking. Pandas are native to China and an international symbol of the country. Chow Chows were painted to resemble pandas at a Chinese zoo (TikTok)

In one visitor’s video, one of the “pandas” was visibly panting while resting on a rock in a fence, while another clip had a panda with a long tail strolling about. “It’s a PANdog,” one viewer wrote, while someone else joked: “That’s the Temu version of a panda.”

“They were panting that’s why they are pandas,” a third noted. After visitors publicized the ruse on social media, the organizers admitted they’d painted two Chow Chows — a fluffy dog breed originally from northern China — with black-and-white panda markings. Since then, visitors have demanded their money back for false advertising. This isn’t the first time a Chinese zoo has misled visitors with claims of housing real pandas. In May, NBC Newsreported that Taizhou Zoo in Jiangsu Province had also painted Chow Chows. Zoo representatives initially claimed that the animals were a rare breed of “panda dogs,” before admitting that such animals don’t exist.

In a bizarre turn of events, a zoo in China has found itself at the center of controversy following an exhibit that featured dogs painted to resemble giant pandas. The unusual display, which was initially promoted as an innovative way to raise awareness about endangered species, has drawn sharp criticism from animal rights activists and the general public alike.

When the exhibit first opened, it garnered positive attention for its creative approach to highlighting the plight of pandas, a species facing significant threats in the wild. Visitors were captivated by the sight of the strikingly painted dogs, which were presented as part of an effort to educate audiences on wildlife conservation.

However, the initial excitement quickly turned to shock and outrage when it was revealed that the featured animals were not actual pandas, but rather dogs that had been dyed to mimic the iconic black-and-white bears. As the truth emerged, social media erupted with condemnation, with many calling the exhibit a misguided and deceptive attempt to exploit the popularity of pandas.

Animal welfare advocates have voiced their concerns over the ethical implications of such a display, arguing that it not only misrepresents the reality of endangered species but also raises questions about the treatment of the animals involved. Critics have demanded accountability from the zoo and called for a reevaluation of how wildlife conservation messages are communicated to the public.

In response to the backlash, the zoo has issued a statement defending its exhibit as a creative educational tool, although it remains to be seen how this controversy will affect future initiatives aimed at promoting wildlife conservation.

The resignations follow drawn-out negotiations with 23andMe CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki, who wants to take the company private. In a Tuesday letter addressed to Wojcicki, the seven directors said they had yet to receive a “a fully financed, fully diligenced, actionable proposal that is in the best interests of the non-affiliated shareholders” from the chief executive after months of efforts. The directors said they would be resigning effective immediately — arguing that, while they still believed in 23andMe's mission, their departures were for the best due to Wojcicki’s concentrated voting power and a “clear” difference of opinion on the company's future. Wojcicki later responded to the resignations in a memo to employees, published in a securities filing, saying she was “surprised and disappointed” by the directors' decision. Still, she maintained that taking 23andMe private and “outside of the short term pressures of the public markets” would be best for the company long term. Wojcicki added that 23andMe would immediately be identifying independent directors to join the board.

Scientists using ice-breaking ships and underwater robots have found the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica is melting at an accelerating rate and could be on an irreversible path to collapse, spelling catastrophe for global sea level rise. Since 2018, a team of scientists forming the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, has been studying Thwaites — often dubbed the “Doomsday Glacier” — up close to better understand how and when it might collapse. Their findings, set out across a collection of studies, provide the clearest picture yet of this complex, ever-changing glacier. The outlook is “grim,” the scientists said in a report published Thursday, revealing the key conclusions of their six years of research. They found rapid ice loss is set to speed up this century. Thwaites’ retreat has accelerated considerably over the past 30 years, said Rob Larter, a marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and part of the ITGC team. “Our findings indicate it is set to retreat further and faster,” he said. The scientists project Thwaites and the Antarctic Ice Sheet could collapse within 200 years, which would have devastating consequences. Thwaites holds enough water to increase sea levels by more than 2 feet. But because it also acts like a cork, holding back the vast Antarctic ice sheet, its collapse could ultimately lead to around 10 feet of sea level rise, devastating coastal communities from Miami and London to Bangladesh and the Pacific Islands.

*West Antarctica* – Thwaites Glacier, often dubbed the ""Doomsday Glacier,"" is drawing increasing attention from scientists and environmentalists alike due to its alarming potential to significantly elevate global sea levels. This massive ice formation has already shed a substantial amount of ice in recent decades, raising concerns about the implications of its continued melting.

The glacier's precarious state is largely influenced by warm ocean currents that are eroding its ice shelves from below. As these currents penetrate the icy continent, they destabilize the glacier, leading to accelerated melting. Researchers warn that if the Thwaites Glacier were to collapse entirely, it could contribute an estimated three to ten feet to sea level rise, with catastrophic consequences for coastal communities around the world.

As global temperatures continue to rise, the fate of Thwaites Glacier remains uncertain.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Swedish authorities on Thursday charged a 52-year-old woman associated with the Islamic State group with genocide, crimes against humanity and serious war crimes against Yazidi women and children in Syria — the first such case on trial in the Scandinavian country. Lina Laina Ishaq, who's a Swedish citizen, allegedly committed the crimes from August 2014 to December 2016, in the city of Raqqa, the former de facto capital of the militant group's self-proclaimed caliphate and home to about 300,000 people. The crimes “took place under IS rule in Raqqa, and this is the first time that IS attacks against the Yazidi minority have been tried in Sweden,” senior prosecutor Reena Devgun said in a statement. The Yazidis are one of Iraq’s oldest religious minorities. “Women, children and men were regarded as property and subjected to being traded as slaves, sexual slavery, forced labor, deprivation of liberty and extrajudicial executions,” Devgun said. “IS tried to annihilate the Yazidi ethnic group on an industrial scale."" In announcing the charges, Devgun told a news conference that the prosecutors were able to identify Ishaq through information from the U.N. team investigating atrocities in Iraq, known as UNITAD. In a separate statement, the Stockholm District Court said the prosecution claims she detained a number of women and children of the Yazidi ethnic group in her residence in Raqqa, and “allegedly exposed them to, among other things, severe suffering, torture or other inhumane treatment"" and also deprived ""them of fundamental rights for cultural, religious and gender reasons contrary to general international law.”

TOKYO/SHANGHAI/TAIPEI (Reuters) - The lethal hack of Hezbollah's Asian-branded pagers and walkie-talkies has sparked an intense search for the devices' path, revealing a murky market for older technologies where buyers may have few assurances about what they are getting. While supply chains and distribution channels for higher-margin and newer products are tightly managed, that's not the case for older electronics from Asia where counterfeiting, surplus inventories and complex contract manufacturing deals can sometimes make it impossible to identify the source of a product, analysts and consultants say. The response from the companies at the centre of the booby-trapped gadgets that killed 37 people and wounded about 3,000 in Lebanon this week has underlined difficulties in discerning how and when they were weaponised. Taiwan-based Gold Apollo put the blame on a Europe-based licensee of its pager, sparking investigations in Hungary, Bulgaria, Norway and Romania into the origins of the deadly device. Japan's Icom said it could not tell if the walkie-talkies bearing its name were real, in a market awash with fake products. ""If the supply chain was compromised to put explosives inside ... it's incredible engineering to do that. But the actual supply chain compromise is not that hard. Probably the easiest part was the supply chain compromise,"" said David Fincher, a China-based technologist and consultant. He said counterfeit products are prevalent, especially in big manufacturing centres like China where fake components can be easily produced, adding that it isn't a big leap to go from fake components to supply chain compromise.

Researchers have finally identified the source of mysterious noises coming from the deepest ocean trench. The odd sounds, described as ""biotwang"" noises, sound a bit like sci-fi starships, and are actually whale calls from Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni). The whales may use the calls to locate one another like a giant game of Marco Polo, researchers say. Scientists first detected the unusual noises in 2014 while using underwater gliders to carry out an acoustic survey of the Mariana Trench — the world's deepest ocean trench, which spans more than 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) south of Japan and has a maximum depth of 35,876 feet (10,935 meters) . The biotwang sound can be broken down into two distinct parts: first, a low, grumbly sound that reverberates through the deep; and second, a high-pitched, metallic ringing that researchers have likened to the sounds made by spaceships in Star Trek and Star Wars. The sounds initially stumped scientists. But in 2016, researchers revealed that biotwang was most likely a call from large baleen whales , such as blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) or humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). However, the sounds did not match any known whale calls. In the new study, published Wednesday (Sept. 18) in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science , researchers were finally able to prove that Bryde's whales were making the noises, thanks in part to new artificial intelligence (AI) tools that sifted through over 200,000 hours of audio recordings containing various ocean sounds.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

A recent study conducted by a dedicated team of researchers has shed light on the origins of unusual underwater sounds detected in the western Pacific Ocean, specifically near the Mariana Trench. This area, known for being the deepest part of the world's oceans, plunges to depths of approximately 36,000 feet (10,973 meters).

The strange noises, initially captured using advanced underwater microphones, were attributed to Bryde's whales, a species known for their complex communication methods. The research team aimed to deepen our understanding of how marine mammals communicate, particularly in the challenging acoustic environment of the deep sea.

Remarkably, the calls of these whales have been found to travel long distances underwater, with some frequencies reaching levels that are inaudible to human ears. This discovery not only highlights the intricate vocalizations of Bryde's whales but also emphasizes the importance of further studies on marine life communication in the ocean's depths.
