They pointed out how Arm’s architecture was being used in the Apple's (AAPL) A18 processor inside the new iPhone 16.

Also last week, Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri initiated coverage on Arm with an ""overweight"" rating and price target of $160. Pajjuri also mentioned the importance of Arm's connection to the iPhone 16, and added that the company was ""well-positioned to benefit from rapid growth of GenAI in the cloud and at the edge.""

*Date: [Insert Date]*

[City, State] – A local pharmaceutical firm specializing in obesity treatments has announced plans for a larger clinical trial of its promising new drug, which was initially anticipated to be a breakthrough in weight management therapies. This development comes after preliminary findings from smaller studies suggested significant potential in reducing body weight among participants.

The upcoming trial aims to recruit a more diverse and larger participant group, reflecting the varied demographics affected by obesity. This move is crucial in ensuring the results are applicable to a broader population. Researchers believe that by including participants from different backgrounds, they can gather more comprehensive data regarding the drug's efficacy and safety.

However, the initial findings have raised concerns, as some potential side effects were identified that warrant further investigation. The firm is committed to rigorously examining these side effects to ensure the safety and well-being of future participants.

As the obesity epidemic continues to rise, the pharmaceutical industry is under increasing pressure to deliver effective treatments. This new drug could represent a significant advance in the fight against obesity, but its path to approval will depend on the outcomes of the upcoming trials.

Investors are digesting the possibility that Trump or other investors who were previously prohibited from selling shares could soon begin doing so.

Trump last week said, ""I'm not going to sell my shares.""

The rough week for shares of Truth Social's parent company continued Friday.

Shares of Trump Media & Technology (DJT), the company majority-owned by former President Donald Trump, were recently down more than 3%, trading around $14.25 per share after finishing last week near $18.

Lock-Up Agreements Expired

The stock is falling as investors digest the possibility that Trump or other company insiders and investors could begin selling shares following the expiration of lock-up agreements that prohibited them from doing so. Trump in an interview last week said, ""I'm not going to sell my shares.""

Selling by major shareholders would likely exert further downward pressure on a stock that earlier this year changed hands at around $70, soaring shortly after Truth Social's then-parent merged with a blank-check company.

The expiration of the lock-up agreements could also ""facilitate increased short selling in the stock,"" according to a Thursday note from S3 Partners.

**By [Your Name]**  
**[Date]**

Truth Social, a social media platform launched with the promise of providing an alternative to mainstream networks, is facing significant hurdles as it seeks to carve out a niche in an already saturated market. Founded by former President Donald Trump, the platform aimed to champion free speech and provide a space for users who feel marginalized by existing social media giants. 

Since its inception, Truth Social has encountered difficulties in attracting a substantial user base, a challenge exacerbated by the fierce competition from established platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Despite its ambitious goals, many users have reported a lack of engaging features and have voiced their dissatisfaction with the platform's overall functionality. Complaints range from technical glitches to a limited array of tools commonly found on rival sites, which has hindered user experience.

The ongoing debate surrounding free speech and censorship has further complicated the narrative surrounding Truth Social. Supporters argue that the platform is essential in promoting open dialogue, especially for those who feel silenced by mainstream platforms. Conversely, critics contend that the site may unintentionally foster misinformation and echo chambers.

As Truth Social navigates these challenges, the question remains: can it transform its vision into a viable social media alternative, or will it succumb to the same pitfalls that have plagued other upstart networks? Only time will tell if Truth Social can adapt and grow in a landscape defined by rapid technological advancements and shifting user expectations.","1.

Subramaniam told analysts that weakness in the industrial economy dragged down business-to-business (B2B) volumes. Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere added that the drop in B2B sales led to a 3% volume decline in U.S. domestic express services.

CFO Says 'Soft Revenue Trends' Affected Results

Chief Financial Officer (CFO) John Dietrich noted that the results ""were negatively affected by soft revenue trends, with a global decline in priority volume and growth in deferred volume.""

Deitrich said in light of the first-quarter performance, FedEx was cutting the top end of its full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) outlook to $21 from $22. FedEx also sees revenue growth to be in a low-single-digit percentage, down from its earlier forecast of a low- to mid-single-digit percentage.

It's Happened Before Key Takeaways The Federal Reserve began what will likely be a campaign of interest rate cuts Wednesday by cutting its influential federal funds rate by half a percentage point. The central bank has made similar moves in the past, sometimes preceding a recession. However, economists aren’t predicting a recession this time around. When the Federal Reserve starts a rate cut cycle with a jumbo-sized slash in the past, it hasn’t always worked out well for the economy. After holding its key interest rates at decades-high levels in a bid to bring down inflation, the Federal Reserve made its first rate cut in four years on Wednesday. While the Fed generally reduces the federal funds rate a quarter-of-a-percentage point at a time, the central bank was more aggressive this week, reducing rates by 50 basis points. In some recent cases, super-sized rate cuts have come before a recession. The Fed, and some economists, think there are reasons that won't happen this time. Has This Happened In the Past? This isn't the first time the Fed has taken a bigger swing at rates to open a rate-cut cycle. In 2001 and 2007, the Fed faced similar situations. After keeping interest rates elevated for an extended period, central bankers cut them quickly by 50 basis points (bp). In these cases, the sharp cuts to interest rates weren’t enough to stave off a recession. “On all the recent occasions when the Fed has accelerated up to 50bp cuts, bad things have then happened,” wrote a team of Deutsche Bank analysts led by research strategist Jim Reid this week.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

In a pivotal move aimed at rejuvenating economic growth, the Federal Reserve announced a reduction in the benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. This decision marks a significant shift in monetary policy as the central bank seeks to encourage borrowing and investment among consumers and businesses alike.

The interest rate was lowered by 25 basis points, bringing it down to a range of 1.50% to 1.75%. This cut comes in response to a troubling decline in consumer confidence, which has been increasingly evident amid ongoing economic uncertainty. Many households are feeling the impact of fluctuating markets and rising inflation, leading to hesitancy in spending and investment decisions.

The last interest rate hike occurred in December 2018, when the Fed increased rates in an effort to combat inflation and support a burgeoning economy. However, as recent data indicates a slowdown in growth, the central bank has shifted its focus to stimulating economic activity through lower borrowing costs.
