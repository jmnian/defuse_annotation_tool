Arm ADRs have jumped some 150% in just over a year as a publicly traded company.

CEO Rene Haas said the decision by the index underscored his firm's rapid growth.

High-flying Arm Holdings (ARM) on Friday announced that it has been added to the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX), effective today.

American depositary receipts (ADRs) of the chip and software design firm have soared about 150% since it began trading on the Nasdaq last September, fueled by demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products.

Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Rene Haas said that in just one year as a public company, ""Arm has continuously reinforced its position as the foundational compute platform across every technology touchpoint."" Haas added that being added to the SOX index ""underscores the rapid growth our company has seen as we continue to diversify our solutions and scale across multiple markets.""

Analysts Bullish on Arm

Last week, Morgan Stanley made Arm ""Our New Top Pick,"" with the analysts calling it ""an important part to the shift in edge AI,"" which is the use of AI data closer to its source, rather than centrally located in a cloud computing facility or data center."" They pointed out how Arm’s architecture was being used in the Apple's (AAPL) A18 processor inside the new iPhone 16.

Also last week, Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri initiated coverage on Arm with an ""overweight"" rating and price target of $160. Pajjuri also mentioned the importance of Arm's connection to the iPhone 16, and added that the company was ""well-positioned to benefit from rapid growth of GenAI in the cloud and at the edge.""

Arm ADRs slipped 1% to $138.41 in late-afternoon trading Friday but are up about 85% this year.

Based on the results, Novo Nordisk said it would be initiating a larger Phase 2b study next year. Novo Nordisk shares were down over 5% in intraday trading Friday, though even with Friday's losses, they've gained more than 22% since the start of the year. Novo Nordisk's (NVO) U.S.-listed shares lost ground Friday after a study of the pharmaceutical firm’s latest obesity treatment showed less effectiveness in higher doses. The company said a Phase 2a trial of the drug monlunabant found patients with a baseline weight of 110.1 kilograms (242.7 pounds) taking 10 milligrams once a day for 16 weeks achieved a drop of 7.1 kilograms (15.7 pounds), versus 0.7 kilograms (1.5 pounds) for those given a placebo. However, increasing the dosage produced “limited additional weight loss.”

Novo Nordisk also reported mild to moderate neuropsychiatric side effects, primarily anxiety, irritability, and sleep disturbances, “were more frequent and dose dependent with monlunabant compared to placebo.”

Novo Nordisk Plans Larger Study Next Year

Based on the results, Novo Nordisk said it would be initiating a larger Phase 2b study next year “to further investigate dosing and the safety profile of monlunabant.”

The company is a leader in the weight-loss medicine category, with the booming popularity of its Wegovy and Ozempic injectables. However, it has received criticism over the high price of the drugs, and a Novo Nordisk executive reportedly said earlier this week that Ozempic is “very likely” to be targeted by the U.S. government for a price cut for Medicare recipients.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

Lennar (LEN) shares dropped Friday despite stronger-than-expected quarterly results as the homebuilder's guidance left investors uninspired.

The company said it expects its fiscal fourth-quarter gross margin on home sales to hold flat quarter-over-quarter at 22.5%, below the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. It expects between 19,000 and 19,300 new home orders and an average sales price of $425,000, in line with Street estimates.

Lennar beat expectations for the third quarter ended August 31, posting revenue that grew 9% year-over-year to $9.4 billion. Earnings per diluted share rose $4.26, while new orders improved 5%.

CEO Stuart Miller pointed to an improving environment for homebuilders. Several homebuilder shares rose Thursday, climbing following the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut rates, which is expected to lead to lower mortgage rates.

""We are pleased to report another solid quarter backed by an economic environment that remains very constructive for homebuilders,” Miller said. “Employment was strong, housing supply remained chronically short due to production deficits of over a decade, and demand was solid driven by strong household formation.”

Jefferies analysts said investors cheered the news of Hill's appointment, marking a vote of confidence for the executive. But they also noted that Hill is facing challenges after his four years away, such as “rising competition and changes in distribution, brand building, and product.”

Hill, who starts his new role on Oct. 14, returns to a company that has seen its stock tumble as it struggled to compete against upstarts like Hoka.

It's Happened Before Key Takeaways The Federal Reserve began what will likely be a campaign of interest rate cuts Wednesday by cutting its influential federal funds rate by half a percentage point. The central bank has made similar moves in the past, sometimes preceding a recession. However, economists aren’t predicting a recession this time around. When the Federal Reserve starts a rate cut cycle with a jumbo-sized slash in the past, it hasn’t always worked out well for the economy. After holding its key interest rates at decades-high levels in a bid to bring down inflation, the Federal Reserve made its first rate cut in four years on Wednesday. While the Fed generally reduces the federal funds rate a quarter-of-a-percentage point at a time, the central bank was more aggressive this week, reducing rates by 50 basis points. In some recent cases, super-sized rate cuts have come before a recession. The Fed, and some economists, think there are reasons that won't happen this time. Has This Happened In the Past? This isn't the first time the Fed has taken a bigger swing at rates to open a rate-cut cycle. In 2001 and 2007, the Fed faced similar situations. After keeping interest rates elevated for an extended period, central bankers cut them quickly by 50 basis points (bp). In these cases, the sharp cuts to interest rates weren’t enough to stave off a recession. “On all the recent occasions when the Fed has accelerated up to 50bp cuts, bad things have then happened,” wrote a team of Deutsche Bank analysts led by research strategist Jim Reid this week.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

Triple-witching often results in greater trading volume and volatility, especially in the final hour of the session. The majority of long-term, buy-and-hold investors shouldn't be too worried, as heightened volatility and unexpected price swings are likely to be short-lived. Stocks rallied to record highs on Thursday ahead of one of Wall Street's scariest-sounding events, set for Friday: a triple witching. ""Triple witching"" refers to the simultaneous expiration of stock options, index options, and index futures contracts. It occurs four times a year—on the third Fridays of March, June, September, and December—and can be known to trigger sharp price movements as traders close out or extend existing positions.

The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), or “fear gauge,” stood at about 16.5 on Thursday, down from spikes in early August and September but still above its 2024 average. What Triple-Witching Means for You
