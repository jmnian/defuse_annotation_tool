In America we consider what to do about the country’s dangerous roads. Each year cars kill roughly 40,000 people there—and not just because it is a big place where people love to drive. The country’s roads are nearly twice as dangerous per mile driven as those in the rest of the rich world. Deaths there involving cars have increased over the past decade, despite the introduction of technology meant to make driving safer. Weight is to blame. Our analysis of 7.5m crashes showed that for every 10,000 crashes the heaviest vehicles kill 37 people in the other car, compared with just 2.6 for the lightest. And the situation is getting worse. In 2023, 31% of new cars in America weighed over 5,000lb (2.27 tonnes), compared with 22% in 2018. This poses a giant collective-action problem.

In a disheartening trend, the United States recorded over 38,000 traffic fatalities in 2020, highlighting a persistent public safety crisis on the nation’s roadways. Notably, young drivers aged 16 to 24 are disproportionately affected, facing a significantly higher risk of traffic-related deaths compared to older demographics.

Despite advancements in vehicle safety technology, such as improved crash tests and the widespread adoption of safety features like automatic braking and lane departure warnings, the death toll from vehicular accidents remains unacceptably high. Experts attribute this troubling statistic to a combination of factors, including distracted driving, speeding, and a lack of experience among younger drivers.

In response to this ongoing issue, government initiatives are being implemented to promote safe driving practices among all road users. These programs aim to educate young drivers on the importance of responsible behavior behind the wheel, including the dangers of texting while driving and the need to adhere to speed limits.

As authorities continue to address this crisis, community outreach and educational campaigns are crucial in fostering a culture of safety on the roads. The hope is that with persistent efforts, the alarming trend of traffic fatalities can be reversed, ultimately saving lives and making America’s highways safer for everyone.","1.

In most of the world we consider why baby-boosting policies won’t work. As birth rates plunge in rich countries, many politicians are keen to pour money into policies that might lead women to have more children. Yet all these attempts are likely to fail, because they are built on a misapprehension. The bulk of the decline in the fertility rate in such countries is among younger, poorer women who are delaying when they start to have children, and who therefore have fewer overall. Focusing on these women as a group would be bad for them and for society. Teenage pregnancies are linked to poverty and ill health for both mother and child. Targeted incentives would roll back decades of efforts to curb unwanted teenage pregnancy and encourage women into study and work.

In a troubling trend, recent studies reveal that many developed nations are grappling with a significant decline in birth rates. According to demographic research, countries such as Japan, Italy, and Germany have reported sustained decreases in fertility, prompting experts to sound the alarm about the implications for future economic stability and the sustainability of social services.

The decline in birth rates raises critical questions about the future workforce. As the population ages and fewer young people enter the job market, the potential for economic growth may be stunted, leading to increased pressure on existing social systems. This demographic shift could result in a shrinking labor force, placing additional burdens on public services such as healthcare and pensions.

In response to this pressing issue, several countries are taking proactive measures. Policymakers are implementing family-friendly policies designed to encourage higher birth rates, including improved parental leave, subsidized childcare, and financial incentives for families with children. These initiatives aim to create an environment where couples feel supported and secure in their decision to start or expand their families.

Experts emphasize that economic stability and job security are crucial factors influencing couples' decisions to have children. In many developed nations, young adults face financial uncertainties, including high housing costs and student debt, which deter them from starting families. Addressing these economic challenges will be essential for reversing the trend of declining birth rates and ensuring a vibrant future workforce.

The agency said it filed a complaint in its administrative court alleging that CVS’s Caremark, Cigna’s Express Scripts and UnitedHealth’s Optum Rx accepted money from drugmakers in exchange for keeping lower-cost insulin off their lists of approved drugs. The companies’ affiliated group purchasing organizations — started in recent years to negotiate rebate payments with drugmakers — were also named. The enforcement action is part of an escalating conflict between the FTC and the three pharmacy benefit managers that together control about 80% of prescriptions filled in the US. Since the companies have merged with larger health conglomerates that also own insurers, pharmacies, and doctors clinics, they’ve faced intensifying pressure in Washington. The drug gatekeepers favored versions of insulin with higher upfront prices and bigger rebate payments from pharmaceutical companies, which shifted more costs onto patients, the FTC alleged.

Society isn’t ready for us to reverse the aging process across an entire population Within the past couple of years, in shots heard literally and figuratively around the developed world, a new class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists, so-called “weight loss drugs,” captivated the world to such an extent that their primary manufacturers, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, can’t keep up with the demand for them. People who were morbidly obese or just slightly overweight suddenly saw the possibility that they could have the svelte body image they wanted. The market for these drugs is expected to reach $100 billion in 2030, after manufacturing finally catches up. Senator Bernie Sanders, no fan of pharmaceutical lobbyists, recently said that demand for these drugs could eventually bankrupt the Medicare program.

Teng stepped into the role of CEO in late 2023 after both Binance and the company’s founder Changpeng Zhao pled guilty last November to criminal charges related to money-laundering on the platform.

As the housing market continues to evolve, a growing number of renters are placing affordability at the forefront of their housing decisions. In recent surveys, it has become clear that economic constraints are driving individuals and families to seek out rental options that align with their financial capabilities. 

In addition to cost, the overall condition and maintenance of rental properties have emerged as significant factors influencing renters' choices. Prospective tenants are increasingly scrutinizing the state of the buildings and amenities before making commitments, emphasizing the importance of well-maintained environments that ensure comfort and safety.

Moreover, an environmental consciousness is taking root in rental preferences. Many renters are now expressing a keen interest in eco-friendly living options, which include energy-efficient appliances, sustainable materials, and green spaces. This shift highlights a broader trend towards sustainability in housing, as individuals recognize the impact of their living choices on the planet.

Location also plays a crucial role in the decision-making process. Renters are actively seeking homes that provide easy access to local shops and restaurants, valuing the convenience and vibrant community life that these amenities offer. The proximity to essential services not only enhances their living experience but also fosters a sense of belonging in their neighborhoods.
