In America we consider what to do about the country’s dangerous roads. Each year cars kill roughly 40,000 people there—and not just because it is a big place where people love to drive. The country’s roads are nearly twice as dangerous per mile driven as those in the rest of the rich world. Deaths there involving cars have increased over the past decade, despite the introduction of technology meant to make driving safer. Weight is to blame. Our analysis of 7.5m crashes showed that for every 10,000 crashes the heaviest vehicles kill 37 people in the other car, compared with just 2.6 for the lightest. And the situation is getting worse. In 2023, 31% of new cars in America weighed over 5,000lb (2.27 tonnes), compared with 22% in 2018. This poses a giant collective-action problem. Individually, it is rational for people to buy bigger cars. Yet the sum of those decisions is much more lethal roads.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

Early Monday morning, as share prices crashed in Tokyo, the markets were on our mind. Later that day, Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister of Bangladesh, fled her country, ending 15 years of increasingly autocratic rule. And by Tuesday, Britain was gripped by what seemed to us to have become its worst race riots since the second world war. All the while we were watching out for a catastrophic escalation of the fighting in the Middle East. Hardly the dog days of August.



Traders say that buying and selling in a crashing market is like catching a falling knife. It’s the same with market covers: you never know whether a plunge like the one we saw on Monday is just the beginning of the red ink or a passing scare. Fortunately, if there was no crash, we had a theme there in front of us, because the fundamental cause of the sell-off was anxiety about an American recession.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

Unusually, we also had one extra digital cover. This was our take on the outcome of the British election, which was determined after we went to press.



Mr Biden had planned for the presidential debate on June 27th to prove his critics wrong about the decline in his mental abilities, and so to revive his ailing campaign. Instead he struggled for 90 agonising minutes to recall words and facts and was unable to land arguments against a weak opponent. It was a catastrophe.



Mr Biden is blameless for his failing powers, but not for the cover-up that followed the debate. Abetted by his family, senior staff and Democratic elites, the president has insisted that he is still up to the world’s toughest job.

In most of the world we consider why baby-boosting policies won’t work. As birth rates plunge in rich countries, many politicians are keen to pour money into policies that might lead women to have more children. Yet all these attempts are likely to fail, because they are built on a misapprehension. The bulk of the decline in the fertility rate in such countries is among younger, poorer women who are delaying when they start to have children, and who therefore have fewer overall. Focusing on these women as a group would be bad for them and for society. Teenage pregnancies are linked to poverty and ill health for both mother and child. Targeted incentives would roll back decades of efforts to curb unwanted teenage pregnancy and encourage women into study and work.

You’re in good company, if so. One of the most powerful figures in philanthropy, Melinda French Gates, recently cut through the noise in an interview with Vanity Fair. Dismissing the supposed valor of executives who fill sleepless nights with work, French Gates calls the phenomenon “so dumb.” In shrugging off the CEO all-nighter, French Gates is also railing against the larger machismo and puritan ethos that praises at least pretending to work oneself to the bone. This past spring, French Gates left the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which she ran for more than 20 years with ex-husband and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Departing with $12.5 billion under her wing, French Gates tweeted that it was time for her to move into the “next chapter” of her philanthropic journey. On her own, French Gates has wasted no time in carving her distinct path. She immediately donated $1 billion to women’s rights and reproductive rights groups, backed a presidential candidate for the first time, and called out other billionaires like Elon Musk for what she described as their lack of philanthropic efforts. That’s all to say: French Gates isn’t holding back. And when it comes to men who say they don’t sleep, she’s not shy about sharing her thoughts. Whether it be their ego or sleep deprivation, these men aren’t necessarily all that great to share a room with, French Gates tells Vanity Fair.

The agency said it filed a complaint in its administrative court alleging that CVS’s Caremark, Cigna’s Express Scripts and UnitedHealth’s Optum Rx accepted money from drugmakers in exchange for keeping lower-cost insulin off their lists of approved drugs. The companies’ affiliated group purchasing organizations — started in recent years to negotiate rebate payments with drugmakers — were also named. The enforcement action is part of an escalating conflict between the FTC and the three pharmacy benefit managers that together control about 80% of prescriptions filled in the US. Since the companies have merged with larger health conglomerates that also own insurers, pharmacies, and doctors clinics, they’ve faced intensifying pressure in Washington. The drug gatekeepers favored versions of insulin with higher upfront prices and bigger rebate payments from pharmaceutical companies, which shifted more costs onto patients, the FTC alleged. The PBMs collected billions in rebates and fees as the list price of a common insulin, Humalog, rose 1,200% between 1999 and 2017, the agency said. It didn’t make its filing available immediately, but described it in materials shared with reporters. The administrative complaint starts a process whereby the allegations will be tried in a formal hearing before an administrative law judge, the agency said.

Society isn’t ready for us to reverse the aging process across an entire population Within the past couple of years, in shots heard literally and figuratively around the developed world, a new class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists, so-called “weight loss drugs,” captivated the world to such an extent that their primary manufacturers, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, can’t keep up with the demand for them. People who were morbidly obese or just slightly overweight suddenly saw the possibility that they could have the svelte body image they wanted. The market for these drugs is expected to reach $100 billion in 2030, after manufacturing finally catches up. Senator Bernie Sanders, no fan of pharmaceutical lobbyists, recently said that demand for these drugs could eventually bankrupt the Medicare program. If the scourge of obesity—which affects more than two in five adults in the U.S.—can be reversed so suddenly by a new development in medical science, it takes no great stretch of the imagination to contemplate the day when another ubiquitous “affliction” can be similarly addressed: aging. Already, research on the primary drivers of aging abounds. Stem cell and proteostatic dysfunction, telomere erosion, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation…all are the subjects of numerous studies, and the work advances each day. In just one example, researchers from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York have recently discovered that T cells in the body can be reprogrammed to slow down and even reverse aging.

In an interview with CNBC, Teng also touted Binance’s 225 million userbase, which he says is exponentially growing. “The first hundred million took us five years to onboard,” Teng said. “The next hundred million took us two years and the pace of adoption is going to be much faster.”

Teng stepped into the role of CEO in late 2023 after both Binance and the company’s founder Changpeng Zhao pled guilty last November to criminal charges related to money-laundering on the platform. Binance agreed to pay a $4.3 million fine to resolve the matter, one of the largest such settlements in U.S. history. In the wake of this transition of leadership, Binance saw an outflow of nearly $1 billion and its native coin, BNB, abruptly fell by 9%. At the time, it was uncertain if Teng would be able to shore up confidence in Binance but, based on his remarks, it appears the company has turned the page on its legal troubles and continued to grow. A former regulator, Teng has sought to shake off Binance’s lawless reputation, in part by adopting a measured tone and leaning into compliance efforts. In the wake of the historic settlement, he has made significant changes to the company’s corporate structure. This has included introducing a board of seven directors as part of an effort to distance the company from Zhao, though most are company insiders.

It’s pet areas and happy hours. “Listings with a turfed pet area, coworking space or community happy hours are drawing more interest as renters appear to be prioritizing practical amenities and community-focused perks,” the analysis read. Completely understandable, in my mind. Who doesn’t love puppies and cocktails? For the analysis, Zillow looked at almost six million rental listings, from apartment complexes to single family homes, and found specific amenities that contributed to more saves and shares per day—a signal of demand, it said. To be clear, this isn’t a science, everyone likes different things. Still, “the most in-demand amenities are off-street parking and in-unit laundry,” according to Zillow. Listings with mentions of off-street parking received 85% more saves and 103% more shares; those with mentions of in-unit laundry received 76% more saves and 67% more shares per day. Of course, those two are somewhat necessary and practical. Fun comes after. Homes with pet-friendly spots resulted in 76% more daily saves and 91% shares; homes with air filtration mechanisms (less fun, but more or less practical in a post-pandemic world) got 72% more saves and 79% more shares; places that offer happy hours got 50% more saves and 67% shares; and rentals with coworking spaces got 16% more saves and 23% more shares.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

Bryan Johnson, a 47-year-old tech founder who invests $2 million a year in his own anti-aging efforts, recently remarked upon Ellison’s appearance. “Ellison, now 80, is doing a good job managing biological aging,” Johnson wrote on X Sunday. Fighting the inevitable and universal experience of growing old has been a project of Ellison’s for years. He’s donated over $350 million to research on aging and age-related disease.

Mortality has perplexed Ellison for decades. His biological mother left his family when Ellison was a child, and his adoptive mother died of cancer during his time in college. “Death has never made any sense to me,” Ellison told biographer Mike Wilson. “How can a person be there and then just vanish, just not be there?”

And are there any examples that you think we can draw lessons from? Deborah Rutter: Technology is something that’s always happening faster than those of us who don’t live in a technology world can keep up with. I remember the conversations when we were going from vinyl LP to eight-track to cassette tape to CD, and the trauma of thinking, “Oh, my goodness, it’s going to put us out of business.” I think the fear can come from the unknown.

Labor shortages are frequent and labor costs are rising. Workforce planning missteps can result in reduced margins and degraded customer service. These workforce challenges affect more than three million people employed at the 40 top-grossing travel and logistics companies. About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Jorge Amar, Neal Parikh, Sal Arora, Scott McConnell, and Taylor Cornwall, with Joseph Faucher, representing views from McKinsey’s Travel, Logistics & Infrastructure Practice. Companies have limited control over the future cost and availability of labor. But proper strategies can help maximize a frontline workforce’s productivity, ensuring the right number of employees are deployed to the right places at the right times. This can build resiliency to handle unexpected events. Across travel and logistics companies—such as airlines, hotels, logistics services providers, and others—significant value could be created through improved workforce management that simultaneously incorporates long-range, near-term, and day-to-day goals. Today’s challenges stem from decisions made over past decades. Although they are rich with data, many companies have underinvested in the foundations and optimization tools that would allow them to use that data to plan more effectively. With limited visibility, workforce planning is often driven by outdated assumptions and methods, frequently resulting in situations where complex workforces are managed using overly simple models and spreadsheets. The tools companies currently use often lack the precision and agility needed to handle today’s workforce complexities in an ever-changing operating environment.

Industry leaders and experts view this shift toward broader services and partner ecosystems as the most promising path to reignited and sustainable growth after many years of declining performance (especially in the European market). As the CEO of one global telco recently noted, “We finally have a shared industry mantra: from traditional telco to techco.”

Talent is a crucial enabler of the “telco to techco” transformation. Without the right capabilities and skills, deployed to maximize their value, even the most impressive tech stack or the richest repository of customer data will be unable to unleash the growth that telcos seek. When asked to identify the key enablers of their value creation plans, more than 80 percent of telco C-suite leaders cited talent—with commercial relationships/organizational setup and culture lagging behind as the other top three priorities (Exhibit 1). 1

Getting talent right is complicated. It involves identifying the skills and capabilities most pivotal to driving growth and finding new ways to attract sought-after workers in a competitive market. It requires an operating model and leadership approach that unleashes productivity, creativity, and collaboration in service of customer-centricity. Talent is also inextricably linked to organizational culture, which can impact candidates’ decisions and, subsequently, their effectiveness and satisfaction on the job. Telcos have traditionally struggled in all of these areas. Previous McKinsey research, for example, revealed that telcos’ key challenges when building new businesses are related to culture—including having too much bureaucracy, a short-term orientation, and lack of management buy-in.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03

For Europe, McKinsey estimates that, by 2030, more than 300,000 public and private charge points will be required across the continent for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, up from roughly 10,000 today. The creation of this new infrastructure represents a significant challenge. Building out robust networks of chargers will require approximately €40 billion of capital investment until 2040. Of this, €7 billion of investments are needed until 2030, less than a quarter of which has been publicly committed today. It will also be energy-intensive, consuming 20 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually by 2030, roughly 0.5 percent of Europe’s total electricity demand. Gaining access to all this energy will often mean securing additional capacity on an already congested grid. At the same time, the possibilities are wide open.
