In America we consider what to do about the country’s dangerous roads. Each year cars kill roughly 40,000 people there—and not just because it is a big place where people love to drive. The country’s roads are nearly twice as dangerous per mile driven as those in the rest of the rich world. Deaths there involving cars have increased over the past decade, despite the introduction of technology meant to make driving safer. Weight is to blame. Our analysis of 7.5m crashes showed that for every 10,000 crashes the heaviest vehicles kill 37 people in the other car, compared with just 2.6 for the lightest. And the situation is getting worse. In 2023, 31% of new cars in America weighed over 5,000lb (2.27 tonnes), compared with 22% in 2018. This poses a giant collective-action problem. Individually, it is rational for people to buy bigger cars. Yet the sum of those decisions is much more lethal roads.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1. Cars kill about 40,000 people in America every year.

And by Tuesday, Britain was gripped by what seemed to us to have become its worst race riots since the second world war. All the while we were watching out for a catastrophic escalation of the fighting in the Middle East. Hardly the dog days of August.

It’s the same with market covers: you never know whether a plunge like the one we saw on Monday is just the beginning of the red ink or a passing scare.

In most of the world we consider why baby-boosting policies won’t work. As birth rates plunge in rich countries, many politicians are keen to pour money into policies that might lead women to have more children. Yet all these attempts are likely to fail, because they are built on a misapprehension. The bulk of the decline in the fertility rate in such countries is among younger, poorer women who are delaying when they start to have children, and who therefore have fewer overall. Focusing on these women as a group would be bad for them and for society. Teenage pregnancies are linked to poverty and ill health for both mother and child. Targeted incentives would roll back decades of efforts to curb unwanted teenage pregnancy and encourage women into study and work.

You’re in good company, if so. One of the most powerful figures in philanthropy, Melinda French Gates, recently cut through the noise in an interview with Vanity Fair. Dismissing the supposed valor of executives who fill sleepless nights with work, French Gates calls the phenomenon “so dumb.” In shrugging off the CEO all-nighter, French Gates is also railing against the larger machismo and puritan ethos that praises at least pretending to work oneself to the bone.

The agency said it filed a complaint in its administrative court alleging that CVS’s Caremark, Cigna’s Express Scripts and UnitedHealth’s Optum Rx accepted money from drugmakers in exchange for keeping lower-cost insulin off their lists of approved drugs. The companies’ affiliated group purchasing organizations — started in recent years to negotiate rebate payments with drugmakers — were also named. The enforcement action is part of an escalating conflict between the FTC and the three pharmacy benefit managers that together control about 80% of prescriptions filled in the US. Since the companies have merged with larger health conglomerates that also own insurers, pharmacies, and doctors clinics, they’ve faced intensifying pressure in Washington. The drug gatekeepers favored versions of insulin with higher upfront prices and bigger rebate payments from pharmaceutical companies, which shifted more costs onto patients, the FTC alleged. The PBMs collected billions in rebates and fees as the list price of a common insulin, Humalog, rose 1,200% between 1999 and 2017, the agency said. It didn’t make its filing available immediately, but described it in materials shared with reporters. The administrative complaint starts a process whereby the allegations will be tried in a formal hearing before an administrative law judge, the agency said.

Society isn’t ready for us to reverse the aging process across an entire population Within the past couple of years, in shots heard literally and figuratively around the developed world, a new class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists, so-called “weight loss drugs,” captivated the world to such an extent that their primary manufacturers, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, can’t keep up with the demand for them. People who were morbidly obese or just slightly overweight suddenly saw the possibility that they could have the svelte body image they wanted. The market for these drugs is expected to reach $100 billion in 2030, after manufacturing finally catches up. Senator Bernie Sanders, no fan of pharmaceutical lobbyists, recently said that demand for these drugs could eventually bankrupt the Medicare program. If the scourge of obesity—which affects more than two in five adults in the U.S.—can be reversed so suddenly by a new development in medical science, it takes no great stretch of the imagination to contemplate the day when another ubiquitous “affliction” can be similarly addressed: aging. Already, research on the primary drivers of aging abounds. Stem cell and proteostatic dysfunction, telomere erosion, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation…all are the subjects of numerous studies, and the work advances each day. In just one example, researchers from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York have recently discovered that T cells in the body can be reprogrammed to slow down and even reverse aging. Gene splicing could also play a role in the future. The race to ‘cure’ aging

In an interview with CNBC, Teng also touted Binance’s 225 million userbase, which he says is exponentially growing. “The first hundred million took us five years to onboard,” Teng said. “The next hundred million took us two years and the pace of adoption is going to be much faster.”

Teng stepped into the role of CEO in late 2023 after both Binance and the company’s founder Changpeng Zhao pled guilty last November to criminal charges related to money-laundering on the platform. Binance agreed to pay a $4.3 million fine to resolve the matter, one of the largest such settlements in U.S. history.

Bryan Johnson, a 47-year-old tech founder who invests $2 million a year in his own anti-aging efforts, recently remarked upon Ellison’s appearance. “Ellison, now 80, is doing a good job managing biological aging,” Johnson wrote on X Sunday. Fighting the inevitable and universal experience of growing old has been a project of Ellison’s for years. He’s donated over $350 million to research on aging and age-related disease. With a self-described “addiction to winning,” Ellison, the newly crowned second-richest person in the world, has applied a similar urgency to his personal health. He’s been known to sip carrot juice and frequent the gym for hours a day. Gina Smith, co-founder and editor-in-chief of media site aNewDomain, said in a 2018 Quora post that when she worked with Ellison in the 1990s and 2000s, he drank only green tea and water, and largely ate fish, vegetables, and fruit. Mortality has perplexed Ellison for decades. His biological mother left his family when Ellison was a child, and his adoptive mother died of cancer during his time in college. “Death has never made any sense to me,” Ellison told biographer Mike Wilson. “How can a person be there and then just vanish, just not be there?”

Microsoft and Constellation Energy, which owns the plant, have struck a deal that will see the plant’s undamaged reactor resume operations to power Microsoft’s AI data centers. Microsoft has signed a 20-year power-purchase agreement with Constellation, which will spend $1.6 billion to restart the reactor. It’s expected to be operational again by 2028. Constellation shares were up 14% in early trading Friday morning. “Before it was prematurely shuttered due to poor economics, this plant was among the safest and most reliable nuclear plants on the grid, and we look forward to bringing it back with a new name and a renewed mission to serve as an economic engine for Pennsylvania,” said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation in a statement.

The facility’s Unit 1 reactor will be restarted. That facility sits next to the Unit 2 reactor that had the partial meltdown in 1979. Unit 1 “permanently shut down” on Sept. 20, 2019 after starting operations in 1974. Constellation purchased the unit in 2000, and it produced enough electricity in the following years to power 800,000 homes for almost two years and “offset more than 95 million metric tons of carbon, the equivalent of nearly 20 million cars off the road,” the company says. Constellation was not the owner of the Unit 2 reactor.

But in recent years, digital forms of art have complemented and perhaps enhanced traditional arts such as opera, film, and dance. In her ten years at the helm of the Kennedy Center, Deborah Rutter has led a variety of initiatives to foster interdisciplinary programming. Rutter spoke with McKinsey senior partner Ian Jefferson about the critical role of technology in the arts and how digital art forms can heighten the live experience. An edited transcript of their conversation follows. Ian Jefferson: Coming out of COVID-19, there was a ramp-up in the use of digital platforms and digital access to the arts. Recently, there has been an increase in conversations about generative AI and its role in the arts. Have you seen technology change the way the arts are performed, created, and experienced? And are there any examples that you think we can draw lessons from? Deborah Rutter: Technology is something that’s always happening faster than those of us who don’t live in a technology world can keep up with. I remember the conversations when we were going from vinyl LP to eight-track to cassette tape to CD, and the trauma of thinking, “Oh, my goodness, it’s going to put us out of business.” I think the fear can come from the unknown. That fear is understood in the world of an artist. But artists are explorers. Artists are always changing, always evolving, looking to see how their art will change over time. So technology is absolutely an important ingredient, an important piece of the action, as it were.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1. Many people think art and technology do not go together.

Labor shortages are frequent and labor costs are rising. Workforce planning missteps can result in reduced margins and degraded customer service. These workforce challenges affect more than three million people employed at the 40 top-grossing travel and logistics companies. About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Jorge Amar, Neal Parikh, Sal Arora, Scott McConnell, and Taylor Cornwall, with Joseph Faucher, representing views from McKinsey’s Travel, Logistics & Infrastructure Practice. Companies have limited control over the future cost and availability of labor. But proper strategies can help maximize a frontline workforce’s productivity, ensuring the right number of employees are deployed to the right places at the right times. This can build resiliency to handle unexpected events. Across travel and logistics companies—such as airlines, hotels, logistics services providers, and others—significant value could be created through improved workforce management that simultaneously incorporates long-range, near-term, and day-to-day goals. Today’s challenges stem from decisions made over past decades. Although they are rich with data, many companies have underinvested in the foundations and optimization tools that would allow them to use that data to plan more effectively. With limited visibility, workforce planning is often driven by outdated assumptions and methods, frequently resulting in situations where complex workforces are managed using overly simple models and spreadsheets. The tools companies currently use often lack the precision and agility needed to handle today’s workforce complexities in an ever-changing operating environment. Newer solutions, such as generative AI (gen AI), can integrate large and disparate data sets to generate fresh capabilities and greater workforce agility.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

business_19.json,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/how-talent-can-power-the-telco-to-techco-transformation,"How talent can power the ‘telco to techco’ transformation Telcos worldwide want to evolve from traditional connectivity providers into customer-centric, platform-oriented innovators akin to today’s top tech players. Industry leaders and experts view this shift toward broader services and partner ecosystems as the most promising path to reignited and sustainable growth after many years of declining performance (especially in the European market). As the CEO of one global telco recently noted, “We finally have a shared industry mantra: from traditional telco to techco.”

Talent is a crucial enabler of the “telco to techco” transformation. Without the right capabilities and skills, deployed to maximize their value, even the most impressive tech stack or the richest repository of customer data will be unable to unleash the growth that telcos seek. When asked to identify the key enablers of their value creation plans, more than 80 percent of telco C-suite leaders cited talent—with commercial relationships/organizational setup and culture lagging behind as the other top three priorities (Exhibit 1). 1

Getting talent right is complicated. It involves identifying the skills and capabilities most pivotal to driving growth and finding new ways to attract sought-after workers in a competitive market. It requires an operating model and leadership approach that unleashes productivity, creativity, and collaboration in service of customer-centricity. Talent is also inextricably linked to organizational culture, which can impact candidates’ decisions and, subsequently, their effectiveness and satisfaction on the job. Telcos have traditionally struggled in all of these areas. Previous McKinsey research, for example, revealed that telcos’ key challenges when building new businesses are related to culture—including having too much bureaucracy, a short-term orientation, and lack of management buy-in.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1. Telcos want to change from being just phone companies to becoming tech companies that help customers more.

3. Many leaders in the telco industry believe that working with more partners will help them grow.  
4. The CEO of a big telco said everyone agrees on this new goal of becoming tech companies.  
5. Having the right talent is very important for this change to happen.  
6. If telcos do not have skilled workers, they cannot grow, even with good technology and data.  
7. More than 80 out of 100 telco leaders think talent is the most important part of their growth plans.  
8. Finding and keeping talented workers is hard for telcos because of competition.  
9. Companies need to create a work environment that encourages teamwork and creativity.  
10. The culture of a company can affect how happy and effective workers are in their jobs.  
11. Telcos have had trouble making these changes because of too many rules and a focus on short-term goals.

business_20.json,https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/building-europes-electric-truck-charging-infrastructure,"Building Europe’s electric-truck charging infrastructure The expected global mass rollout of electric trucks is going to require a dense charging network to keep these zero-emission vehicles moving. For Europe, McKinsey estimates that, by 2030, more than 300,000 public and private charge points will be required across the continent for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, up from roughly 10,000 today. The creation of this new infrastructure represents a significant challenge. Building out robust networks of chargers will require approximately €40 billion of capital investment until 2040. Of this, €7 billion of investments are needed until 2030, less than a quarter of which has been publicly committed today. It will also be energy-intensive, consuming 20 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually by 2030, roughly 0.5 percent of Europe’s total electricity demand. Gaining access to all this energy will often mean securing additional capacity on an already congested grid. At the same time, the possibilities are wide open. With no incumbent players fully established in the electric truck–charging market, companies from a variety of arenas have an opportunity to shape the ecosystem of market participants, creating new businesses or forging strategic collaborations. This article is based on charging infrastructure research from the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility and McKinsey’s EV Charging Infrastructure Service Line. We look at how Europe’s charging network will evolve over the next decade and beyond, identifying major challenges players will need to solve for. Our analysis also details the steps fleet operators will need to take as they develop strategies for a successful scale-up of their truck charging infrastructure—efforts that will inevitably require collaborative actions from fleet operators; truck manufacturers; turnkey engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firms; finance providers; and energy and infrastructure players.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

4. Building the charging network will cost around €40 billion by 2040.  
5. Until 2030, about €7 billion needs to be invested in charging points.  
6. Most of the money needed for charging points has not been promised yet.  
7. The charging network will use a lot of electricity, about 20 terawatt-hours each year by 2030.  
8. This electricity use will be about 0.5 percent of all the electricity Europe uses.  
9. Making sure there is enough electricity will be hard because the current grid is busy.  
10. Many different companies can help build this new charging network.  
11. There are no big companies already in charge of electric truck charging, so there is room for new businesses.  
12. Many groups, like truck makers and energy providers, will need to work together to build the charging network.  "
