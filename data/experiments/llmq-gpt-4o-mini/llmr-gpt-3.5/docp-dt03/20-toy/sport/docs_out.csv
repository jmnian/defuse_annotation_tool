Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins is preparing to make his season debut during the team's Week 3 matchup with the Washington Commanders.

Higgins told reporters on Friday that he ""feels great"" heading into the game, via NFL Network's Cameron Wolfe.

""Finally ready to get my feet wet this season and ready to go,"" he said.

Higgins has missed Cincinnati's first two games of the year after he suffered a hamstring injury in practice on Sept. 5.

It's worth noting that Bengals head coach Zac Taylor hasn't officially confirmed that Higgins will be active against Washington, but it's still a promising sign that the 25-year-old is confident in his ability to return.

He was listed as a limited participant in practice on Thursday and Friday in the Bengals' latest injury report.

Higgins was considered doubtful ahead of Cincinnati's Week 2 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs and he ultimately didn't suit up. He'll have an extra day to prepare for the Commanders, as they're set to clash with the Bengals on Monday Night Football.

The reintroduction of Higgins into Cincinnati's offense should provide a boost to a team that has started the 2024 season with a disappointing 0-2 record. The Bengals have averaged just 272 yards per game through two weeks, ranking No. 24 among all NFL teams.

Although Higgins was limited to just 12 appearances in 2023 due to hamstring issues, he was able to surpass 1,000 receiving yards in each of the prior two seasons.

His potential debut should also make life easier for three-time Pro Bowl wideout Ja'Marr Chase. Chase has been given extra attention from defenses to start the year, which has hampered his overall production. The 24-year-old has recorded just 10 catches for 97 yards in two games.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

Two of the best wide receivers in the NFL are expected to be on the field for their respective Week 3 games. Justin Jefferson and CeeDee Lamb each received positive prognosis about their injury issues, which is something that can't be said for the rest of the stars across the NFL. Christian McCaffrey is already on injured reserve, Deebo Samuel is out for a weeks and a slew of other running backs and wide receivers are dealing with ailments that could keep them out of Week 3. Below is a look at all of the significant injuries that could affect fantasy football matchups across Week 3. Justin Jefferson Off Injury Report

Justin Jefferson was taken off the Minnesota Vikings injury report on Friday. Jefferson's status was up in the air because of a quad injury, but he practiced well enough this week that the injury is not a concern. The superstar wide out will be needed for Minnesota's home clash with the Houston Texans, which has the potential to be a high-scoring affair. Jefferson is always the primary target in Minnesota when healthy, but he should have more targets in Week 3 because Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson are still out. Jefferson earned seven targets from Sam Darnold in Week 2. Only running back Aaron Jones had more than four targets against the New York Giants. Houston's defense may give Jefferson some fits, led by cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. but it has allowed 330 receiving yards to opposing wide outs on just 20 catches through two weeks. Jefferson is an automatic start whenever he's healthy, and his star power may be needed more on certain fantasy rosters in Week 3 depending on how many injuries affect a single roster.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert told reporters Friday that he is dealing with a high-ankle sprain suffered during the team's Week 2 win over the Carolina Panthers.

Herbert said that while the pain related to the injury is ""not great,"" his status for the team's Week 3 road game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday is to be determined.

NFL Network's Ian Rapoport (h/t Geoffrey C. Arnold of The Oregonian) reported that Herbert was ""extremely limited"" during Thursday's practice.

Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh told reporters on Wednesday that Herbert was dealing with an ankle injury, and that he expected the quarterback ""to get better every day.""

""I was in a meeting with him,"" Harbaugh said. ""Said he was feeling much better and good today.""

Herbert underwent X-rays on his right leg on Monday which came back negative, Harbaugh told reporters.

The Chargers quarterback was injured during Week 2's 26-3 win over the Panthers after taking a hit in the third quarter. He did not miss any playing time, but he was seen walking with a ""significant limp"" after the game, per ESPN's Kris Rhim.

Herbert finished Week 2's game having gone 14-of-20 for 130 yards, two touchdowns, an interception and a fumble lost on the play during which he was injured.

He had previously led the Chargers to a 22-10 season-opening win over the Las Vegas Raiders at home with 17-of-26 passing for a touchdown and no picks.

If Herbert is unable to play, the Chargers will turn to Easton Stick, with Taylor Heinicke serving as backup.

When deciding between staying at UConn or accepting a job to be the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, Dan Hurley consulted an NBA coach who faced a similar decision more than a decade ago. The Huskies head coach sought advice from Chicago Bulls head coach Billy Donovan, per CT Insider's David Borges. Donovan won a pair of championships at Florida in 2006 and 2007 and was offered the head coaching position for the Orlando Magic, which he initially accepted before retracting his commitment to return to Gainesville. ""We didn't get into the Lakers' situation or their personnel,"" Donovan said. ""I think Danny needed to go through whatever he went through. He was going to be able to find out the inner workings of the Lakers. I don't know anything about that ... Danny had to go through that on his own."" Hurley is coming off back-to-back championships with UConn, but he was offered a job to lead one of the most historic franchises in NBA history as well as one of the greatest players of all time in LeBron James. The allure of the Lakers' head coaching job wasn't enough to pull him from the collegiate ranks just yet, though.

Fantasy football managers should avoid starting veteran running back Kareem Hunt even though he was signed to the Kansas City Chiefs' practice squad on Tuesday.

According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid confirmed that Hunt will not be elevated to Kansas City's active roster for a matchup with the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday.

With starting running back Isiah Pacheco currently on injured reserve due to a leg injury, Samaje Perine should see the majority of available snaps in the backfield.

Reid is likely giving Hunt more time to learn the Chiefs' playbook and prepare for his 2024 debut, as he's spent the past five seasons on the Cleveland Browns after his 2018 campaign in Kansas City.

He'll still have time to move up from the practice squad, as Pacheco is expected to miss at least six weeks after suffering a fractured fibula during the team's win over the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 2.

In the meantime, Perine will start for Kansas City on Sunday. The veteran has primarily operated in a complementary role for the Denver Broncos and Cincinnati Bengals over the past two seasons, offering value on the ground and through the air.

Since 2022, Perine has racked up 632 rush yards and 742 receiving yards to go along with seven total touchdowns in 33 appearances.

He's only started three games over that span, but the results are promising. In those three starts, Perine recorded 186 yards on the ground and 157 yards as a receiver.

Bleacher Report catches you up on the latest news from the WWE Universe and All Elite Wrestling. Omega Says He's Not Medically Cleared to Wrestle

Kenny Omega has not wrestled since December or appeared on AEW programming in any capacity since May, and comments made by the former AEW world champion on Friday suggest his absence may not be coming to an end any time soon. In a post on X in which he hyped the inclusion of fellow AEW star Samoa Joe in the upcoming Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii video game, Omega noted that he is ""not medically cleared"" to compete:

The manner in which Omega revealed the information suggests he could be joking, but he has indeed battled his fair share of health issues since the inception of AEW. His most recent ailment is a bout with diverticulitis. When Omega appeared on an episode of Dynamite in May, he said he required surgery and noted that doctors told him he was lucky to be alive. Omega was then written off TV again due to an attack by Elite members The Young Bucks, Jack Perry and Kazuchika Okada. When Okada signed with AEW, it was an exciting prospect for wrestling fans since it meant the potential reprisal of his classic rivalry with Omega during their time together in New Japan Pro-Wrestling. That is likely still the end goal once Omega returns, but there remains no publicly known timeline for that to happen.

Shohei Ohtani's historic 50th home run of the season for the Los Angeles Dodgers is one of the most valuable baseballs in history.

David Kohler, president of SCP Auctions, told TMZ Sports the ball would likely sell for around $500,000 if it were to be made available at auction.

Ohtani became the first player in MLB history with 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in a season in the Dodgers' 20-4 victory over the Miami Marlins on Thursday. He hit his 50th homer in the seventh inning off Marlins reliever Mike Baumann.

While the fan who caught the ball has yet to be identified, Darren Rovell and Will Stern of CLLCT.com noted the person is believed to be a man in his 50s.

Craig Mish of the Miami Herald added the fan elected to keep the ball even though the Dodgers made an attempt to negotiate a deal to get it for Ohtani.

TMZ noted there's no word yet on whether or not the fan intends to sell the ball.

The two-run blast came as part of a 6-for-6 day in which Ohtani hit three homers, two doubles, stole two bases and drove in 10 runs. His home run total now sits at an NL-high 51 with nine games remaining in the regular season.

Ohtani is just the seventh player in MLB history to record at least 17 total bases in a single game.

Josh Allen has some advice for Caleb Williams

During an appearance on The Facility on FS1, the Buffalo Bills quarterback said that Williams needs to ""just keep playing football"" and that a rough start can be overcome.

""If the first couple of games in your NFL career don't go your way, it doesn't mean it will define your career,"" Allen said. ""I think he's got to just keep working hard and playing football the way he knows how to play the game.""

Williams was the No. 1 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft after an elite college career at Oklahoma and USC. He won the 2023 Heisman Trophy and threw for 10,082 yards and 93 touchdowns in his career.

His NFL tenure has been much less successful so far, although it has barely started. He won his first start for the Chicago Bears but his performance was not a big reason why as he only threw for 93 yards and had a completion percentage under 50 percent.

In his second game against the Houston Texans, he went 23-37 for 174 yards but threw two interceptions in a 19-13 loss.

He has plenty of time to improve but the warning bells appear to be sounding. However, Allen may be the best example of how a player can overcome a slow start.

Allen went 5-6 in his rookie season while throwing for 2,074 yards with 10 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. Since then, he has led Buffalo to five consecutive playoff appearances, four consecutive division titles and has been named to two Pro Bowls. He is among the best quarterbacks in the league and is the caliber of player Chicago hopes Williams can develop into.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

The Dallas Cowboys have increased their use of analytics.

Seth Walder of ESPN released the results of a survey from the NFL teams that detailed which franchises have embraced analytics the most. The Cleveland Browns were named as the team that utilizes analytics the most for the fourth consecutive season but the Cowboys were named as the team that has improved the most in the metric.

Dallas received 13 of 20 votes from the teams that sent in an answer. This was due to ""substantial staffing changes,"" with notable hires including director of strategic football operations John Park and the addition of Kathy Evans to the analytics group.

Park had previously been with the Indianapolis Colts while Evans had worked with the Washington Wizards and Mystics of the NBA and WNBA. The franchise also added four other full-time employees to the analytics team and two strategic football fellows, per Walder.

When asked why the Cowboys were the most improved, the resources the team has were viewed as a reason why.

""The growth of their team,"" an AFC staffer told Walder. ""It's Dallas, they have more resources than anybody. It's been cool to see that department grow.""

Dallas' play during the 2023 regular season would have some wondering why a change in approach was necessary. The Cowboys went 12-5 and won the NFC East. This was the third consecutive season that the team qualified for the playoffs, but the Wild Card performance showed exactly what was wrong.

It's no small thing for the Pacers to give up their No. 8 pick in 2023, but Walker needs a lot of time on the court to develop. He could become an impact power forward, but he won't get much chance behind Pascal Siakam and Obi Toppin.

Carter has a team-friendly contract at $12 million this season and $10.9 million next. He's still just 25, but at 6'10"", 270 pounds, he would give the Pacers a bigger, stronger backup to Myles Turner (who is in the last year of his contract).

Indiana also loses center Isaiah Jackson, who is extension-eligible this summer. While he's active and athletic, Jackson (6'9"", 205 lbs) doesn't have nearly the same heft as Carter, who better fills the team's rotational need than Jackson and Walker.

The Pacers need to return to the minimum of 14 standard contracts, but the team is awfully close to the NBA's $170.8 million luxury tax threshold. The best way to stay under would probably be converting Enrique Freeman or Tristen Newton.

Both were drafted in the second round and signed two-way contracts, but they would only count against the tax at almost $1.2 million.

The Baltimore Ravens and running back Justice Hill reportedly agreed to a contract extension Friday. According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, Hill and the Ravens came to terms on a two-year, $6 million deal. Hill, 26, has spent his entire five-year career in Baltimore, and he is now under contract with the team through the 2026 campaign thanks to his new pact. Baltimore originally selected Hill in the fourth round of the 2019 NFL draft after he enjoyed a standout collegiate career at Oklahoma State that included two 1,000-yard rushing seasons and 30 total rushing touchdowns over three seasons. Despite that, Hill had a fairly limited role in the Ravens' offense over his first three seasons, averaging about 182 rushing yards, eight catches for 49 yards and less than one touchdown per year during that stretch. Hill was utilized far more often last season, though, perhaps due in large part to the fact that running back J.K. Dobbins was lost for the season after just one game, while veteran running back Melvin Gordon struggled. Gus Edwards was the Ravens' go-to running back as a rusher last season, but Hill was the primary third-down back, and his stats improved as a result. In fact, Hill set career highs across the board with 84 carries for 387 yards and three touchdowns, plus 28 receptions for 206 yards and a score. The Ravens' backfield underwent some significant changes during the offseason, as both Edwards and Dobbins signed with the Los Angeles Chargers in free agency, while Baltimore signed longtime Tennessee Titans running back and potential future Hall of Famer Derrick Henry.",gpt-4o-mini,dt03,"1.

New York Jets rookie running back Braelon Allen has gotten off to a strong start this season, prompting some fans to wonder how he fell to the fourth round of the 2024 draft.

Allen responded cheekily on social media on Friday, saying prospective teams ""wanted to see me run in my underwear"" during the pre-draft process:

After spending three years at Wisconsin, Allen was given a prospect grade of 6.10 by NFL.com, which projected him to be a ""good backup with the potential to develop into a starter."" His pre-draft evaluation likely took a hit because his production in his junior year dipped to 984 rushing yards after he impressed with 1,268 yards and 1,242 yards during his freshman and sophomore seasons, respectively. However, the Badgers installed a new offense in his junior year, which undoubtedly played a factor in his output.

Allen wasted no time proving his prognosticators wrong, as he's been one of New York's most impactful players over the past two weeks. The 20-year-old, who is the youngest player in the NFL, scored his first touchdown on a pass from Aaron Rodgers and rushed for the go-ahead score in the fourth quarter of the Jets' Week 2 win against the Tennessee Titans.

Allen was voted as the AFC Rookie of the Week, and he followed that up by recording a team-high 55 yards in Thursday night's win against the New England Patriots. He's impressed with his ability to run through contact and punish defenders whenever he touches the ball.
