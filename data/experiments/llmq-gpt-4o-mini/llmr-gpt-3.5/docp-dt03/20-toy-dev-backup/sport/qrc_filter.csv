Reason: The question incorrectly assumes that Tee Higgins has avoided injuries throughout his entire NFL career. However, the document clearly states that Higgins suffered a hamstring injury in practice on Sept. 5, causing him to miss the first two games of the 2024 season. This indicates that he has had injuries during his NFL career, so the question's assumption is false.","The answer provided does not address the confusion in the question. The question assumes that Tee Higgins avoided injuries throughout his entire career in the NFL due to his reputation for making acrobatic catches and demonstrating strong route-running skills. However, the document does not mention Higgins avoiding injuries throughout his entire career; it focuses on his injury status and potential season debut in Week 3. The answer does not clearly explain this confusion to the user. The answer is: No.",no
